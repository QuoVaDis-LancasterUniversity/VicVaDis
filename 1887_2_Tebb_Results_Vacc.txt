PREFACE. npO accuse Anti-Vaccinists of making reckless and unsupported statements at their Public Conferences and Meetings, has become a favourite pastime with pro-vaccinal journals, and we are elegantly described by our impatient adversaries, as "a set of ignorant fanatics," whose only motive is a "malignant craze to spread smallpox throughout the land." This charge of ignorance, which in the present instance is a very useful substitute for unwelcome public discussion, comes with ill fitting grace, when it is remembered that Vaccination was the product of an age when the medical profession and the general population were alike in a state of profound ignorance of the laws which govern epidemic disease, and that Jenner's discovery was accepted with little or no examination as a substitute for the greater evil of universal smallpox -inoculation, which, so far from being an infliction upon all future generations, has become a penal offence. While, on the other hand, the opposition to Vaccination is coincident with more enlightened views on sanitation generally, iv Preface. and is practically due to the spread of education throughout the country. And quite recently, a new method of evading the long discussion has been ingeniously discovered by the medical press ; and an attempt is being made to take us in flank, by proposing that vaccinal compulsion, instead of being withdrawn, shall be boldly extended on the grandest scale, till it includes every known zymotic and epidemic disease. What a vision of El Dorado to the delighted eyes of expectant operators ! In this way the Lancet has recently said : "The opponents of Vaccination have lately " held their annual meeting. They continue to " abuse the most beneficent Acts that were ever " passed. It is a curious study to notice the " pilgrimage to Paris, from every country in " Europe and from America, of those in danger " of hydrophobia, to take the chance of safety " from a new and as yet unproved kind of inoculation ; and the contemporaneous meeting of a " few victims of the Anti-Vaccination craze in " Bloomsbury, to disparage and denounce the " Vaccination whose efficacy has been proved to " demonstration by the all but absolute immunity " of smallpox hospital nurses. Much was made " of the freedom of Leicester and other places " from smallpox. The test is to come, and then Preface. V " not a few who are now decrying Vaccination, " will either rush off to the Vaccination office, " as those bitten by mad dogs are doing to " M. Pasteur, or pay the penalty of disfigurement " or death. After all, smallpox is the school- " master that drives people to Vaccination and " keeps green the fame of Jenner." This was written April 24th, 1886, only a year ago, and already upwards of eighty deaths are reported amongst Pasteur's "protected" patients, and a number of these are shewn to have died of "paralytic rabies," a new disease introduced by Pasteur's latest mode of treat ment, which method promises to be more fatal to its votaries, in proportion to the numbers inoculated, than Vaccination itself The following address is reprinted, with notes illustrating the statements publicly made, by documentary and other evidence, so that the unprejudiced reader may judge whether the arguments shewing the danger, cruelty, and injustice of Compulsory Vaccination, are borne out by facts. One great evil of the existing state of things is, that the medical officers of the Local Govern ment Board, having an "infallible preventive" in Vaccination, are under no incentive to find out the true causes of smallpox, or to follow up the vi Preface. suggestions made by Dr. Farr, who in his official report for 1876, says, "Experience has shewn that the various forms of plague are influenced to a large extent by sanitary conditions.* All zymotic diseases are most fatal in the densest districts, and although this may be due in part to contagion, it is certainly due in part to the concentrated impurities of towns." * Of all the practical sciences, public sanitation is the one which has made the greatest progi^ess in recent years. It disarms the infectious diseases ; and by its means the average duration of human life, which in 1788 was 29 years, became 35 in 1835, and is now increased to 40 and upwards. —Dr. Jules Rochard, in Revue des Deux Mondes, February 1st, 1887. The Agitation against Compulsory Vaccination. PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. Without taking an unduly optimistic view of the course of our agitation, I think you will agree with me, that there is much to en courage us in the outspoken testimonies from eminent advocates of our cause at home and abroad, and particularly from Members of Parliament, which our Secretary has just read. Those who have studied Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace's Pamphlet, entitled " Forty-five Years of Registration Statistics," will agree with Mr. Isaac Holden, that the argument is unanswerable, and that Compulsory Vaccination cannot be long maintained. It appears, also, * Mr. Wallace summarises the results of his statistical inquiries as 1. —^Vaccination does not diminish smallpox mortality, as shewn by follows : the 45 years of the Registrar-General's statistics, and by the deaths from smallpox of our "re-vaccinated" soldiers and sailors, which are as numerous as those of the male population of the same ages of several of our large towns, although the former are picked, healthy men, while the latter include many thousands who live under the most insanitaiy conditions. 2. —While thus powerless for good, Vaccination is a certain cause for disease, and death in many cases, and is the probable cause of about 10,000 deaths annually by five inoculable diseases of the most terrible and disgusting character, which have increased to this extent, steadily, year by year, since Vaccination has been enforced by penal laws. 3- —Hospital statistics, shewing a greater mortality of the unvaccinated than of the vaccinated, have been proved to be untrustworthy ; while the conclusions drawn from them are shewn to be necessarily false. 8 Early Opposition. from Mr. Holden's communication,* that Mr. Gladstone has read the pamphlet, and shares in this opinion. It is now about twenty-five years since the agitation for the repeal of the Vaccination Laws was initiated in England, but it is only within the past few years that tangible and encouraging progress has been shown. Without a single representative in Parliament, and with the public press either wholly apathetic or entirely hostile, the early advocates of our cause did what they could to oppose the mischievous delusion under the difficult circumstances in which they were placed. They openly proclaimed their principles, and challenged discussion on every suitable occasion. They denounced unceasingly the wickedness and injustice of compulsory vaccine diseases, and, believing that what was morally wrong could never be politically right, they set their faces inflexibly and unflinchingly against any and every compromise as a substitute for complete emancipation ; and they proved their sincerity by the sufferings and sacrifices they were ever ready to undergo in the cause which they had espoused. Stringent Coercion Demanded. No great time had elapsed after the enactment of the compulsory law of 1853, when it was discovered that it had not had the slightest * Letter read at the Annual Meeting, see Appendix, p. 31. Mo7'e Strmorent Coercion. C3 9 effect in extinguishing or diminishing smallpox, but, on the contrary, the mortality from this disease had rather increased than otherwise. Our opponents, however, maintained that this was because the law was not rigorously enforced, and they succeeded in persuading Parliament in 1867, * to pass an Act which would punish the intelligent opponents of the vaccine dogma with an unlimited number of penalties, under one of the most despotic laws ever passed in this country. The vaccine leaders, however, in ex pecting to crush out conscientious convictions by means of physical force, showed that they had studied history to but small advantage, for they soon discovered, what they ought to have known before, that the only effect of these repeated prosecutions was to create a widespread sym pathy with the victims of this ridiculous medical superstition, and to intensify the opposition to the law throughout the country. * Vaiious attempts have been made to get rid of this obnoxious law, more oppressive in its operation on early infancy than any Vaccination enactment in Europe. The Vaccination Committee of 1 871, composed as it originally was of partisans of Vaccination, with the solitaiy exception of Mr. Jacob Bright, realized its hard-hearted cnielty, and in their report recommended, "That whenever in any case two penalties, or one full penalty, have laeen imposed upon a parent, the magistrate should not impose any further penalty in respect of the same child." This recommendation was embodied in the Vaccination Bill of 1871, which was carried by 57 to 12 ; but was rejected in the House of Lords on the 1 8th August, 1 871, by 8 to 7. In 1880 the Government introduced a Bill to limit the penalties against persons refusing Vaccination to one full penalty of twenty shillings, or two penalties of smaller amount, which was practically opposed by the medical profession en bloc. The British Medical Journal organized a determined opposition to what it described as "a most pernicious and dangerous measure." It says, "We have good parliamentairy authority for Stiying that the Bill lies in the hcincls of our 10 Inquiry Invited. Inquiry and Discussion Invited. From the outset, we have demanded free and open inquiry on every phase of this many-sided question ; but our demand has been constantly and most vigilantly eluded. Those who have been in the habit of attending our monthly con ferences, held at Anderton's Hotel, (and I observe many familiar faces before me,) are aware that it is the custom of the Executive Committee to send special invitations to the leading upholders of Compulsory Vaccination, and particularly to those who display their opposition in the columns of the press ; to directors of smallpox hospitals, medical officers Association," and by means of numerous medical deputations and medical Bill. The petition of the British Medical Association says:—"The petitions, it claims to have induced the Government to withdraw the outcry against Compulsory Vaccination is mainly due to certain interested persons, who, by the dissemination of inflammatoiy literature and by the propagation of falsehoods and distorted statements, stir up opposition to Vaccination on the part of ignorant and thoughtless people." The blind infatuation of a certain section of the profession is the Medical Press and Circnlar, August 22nd, 18S3. —"From a pm-ely curiously disclosed by the following passage from a leading article in humanitarian point of view, the frequency with which syphilitic eruptions follow Vaccination, is a subject for congratulation. In the vast majority of cases the disease is inherited, and excited to evidence itself by the irritating influence of Vaccination, and in this way early treatment is resorted to with prospects of success, which could never be entertained if the infection lurked unrecognised for years in the system of the child. This aspect of the subject is never dwelt on by the fanatical band of opponents to the Vaccination Acts. They know too well how much tinth it veils, and that the possession of it by the masses to whom they address their wild appeals would assuredly result in their own immediate downfall. But while the low motive of personal interest may Ije held to excuse their actions, nothing can lessen the giave responsibilities of a member of the medical profession, however obscure and insignificant, who so far forgets the dignity of his calling, and the allegiance he owes to its traditions, as to pander to a demagogic hatred of that law which compels the preservation of health and a rigid obsen'ance of hygiene." The Professio7i Challenged. 1 of health, public vaccinators, members of boards of guardians, and all who are concerned either in maintaining the practice of Vaccination or in administering the law. Our able and eloquent advocate, Mr. Alfred Milnes, has challenged the British Medical Association, and I may say the entire medical profession, twenty-six thousand strong, to produce a champion for public debate. But with a conscientious conviction of the weak ness of their defences, and probably remembering the discomfiture of Mr. Ernest Hart, when confronted with Dr. Enoch Robinson and Dr. Haughton a few years ago, and the late Dr. W. B. Carpenter, at Steinway Hall in 1882, when opposed by Dr. Pearce and Dr. Collins, this learned body has ingeniously de clined the encounter. Having thus conspicuously exhibited their valour, they are now at liberty, which they freely exercise, to attack and mis represent the advocates of our cause in their one sided medical journal, and disposing themselves under the shelter of this barricade in defence of their own establishment and endowment by the State, they, no doubt, account themselves a brave and indispensable contingent of a noble profession, but one, it must be confessed, in desperate fear of inquiry into the proofs of the Jennerian system. Some of you will remember that, in the debate on Supply last September, members of Parlia ment on both sides of the House strongly urged upon the Government the appointment of 12 A Royal Conunission Demanded. a Royal Commission of Inquiry ; * indeed, the recommendation was made by Mr. Stansfeld himself, when President of the Local Govern ment Board, in reply to a deputation from this Society about a year ago, and, inasmuch as the law has been instrumental in producing a more widespread feeling of injustice and discontent, and more open and defiant opposition than any law on the Statute Book at the present moment, one would have thought such a reasonable request could not very well have been refused. The Local Government Board have, however, con tinuously determined otherwise. Mr. Ritchie said in reply to this request : * The Lancet, as far back as 1878, said, "Nothing short of a Royal Commission will suffice to allay public anxiety." And the British Medical Jotirnal for April 24th, 1 886, writes : —"We are of opinion that a Royal Commission would be the best means of investigating the numerous alarmist statements with which the press is flooded, and of bringing out once more the inestimable benefits of Vaccination and re-vaccination." The existing Government has been designated a Government of Royal Commissions and Committees of Inquiry, and has instituted a series of Parliamentary Inquiries upon Historical Manuscripts, Civil Establishments, Gold and Silver Currency, Town Holdings, Adulteration of Butter, Trade Marks, Truro Bishoprics, Police Pensions, War Office Sites, the Condition and Management of Imbeciles, Pasteur's Inoculation for Hydrophobia, &c. , which makes the injustice of the persistent refusal to include the subject of Vaccination the more conspicuously flagrant. On October 1st, 1881, the Epidemiological Society of London appointed a Special Committee consisting of Dr. Robert Cory, Dr. John McCombie, and Mr. Shirley Murphy, "to ascertain the evidence whijh the present state of medical knowledge supplies, as to the conditions affecting the protection against smallpox afforded by Vaccination." Forms to be filled up, containing seven questions, were circulated among the profession. The results have not been disclosed. In 1882, a Committee of fifteen vaccine specialists met at the Council Chamber, Exeter Hall, and instituted a Medical Inquiry into some important features of the question. The results as disclosed in the "Transactions of the Vaccination Inquiry," edited by Dr. MONTAGUE Makuna, have shewn the medical profession to be in so hopeless a state of confusion concerning all the elementary facts and foundations of Jenner's discovery, that the medical journals have deemed it prudent The Official Ansiver. 13 " If there is one subject on which the Govern ment possesses accurate information more than another it is the subject of Vaccination, and therefore her Majesty's Ministers could not con sent to any Committee of Inquiry into the Vaccination Laws ; not because they fear the result of an inquiry, but because, while on the one hand they do not believe the inquiry would have the least effect in removing the objections of those who at present resist the law, on the other hand it might have the effect of implying doubts on the part of the Government which the Government do not possess in the slightest degree." It sometimes happens that we have, a great respect for a man's opinions until he gives his to refrain from publishing the disclosures. The answers to the third question, viz : —What diseases have you known to be occasioned or intensified by Vaccination ? are too important, however, to be suppressed. Two Hundred and Forty-Two medical witnesses, almost all pro-vaccinists, testified to the following diseases within their own experience : Witneases. Abdominal phthisis. I Witnesses. Gangrenosa 4 Witnesses. General debility ... I Angeioleucitis 2 Rickets i Pyrexia i Blindness I Herpes 3 Scald head i Impetigo 9 Boils 19 Scarlatina 3 Bronchitis i Bullse I Inflammation 10 Scrofula 9 Lichen 7 Septicemia i Cancer i Marasmus I Skin disease 24 Struma intensified... 4 Meningitis 2 Cellulitis 5 Convulsions 4 Paralysis 1 Phagedenic action.

The Official Answer. reasons, and, in the interests of Vaccination, Mr. Ritchie had better have omitted to state his reasons altogether, for a more unsatisfactory explanation could hardly have been invented. It is not denied that the Government are well informed concerning the results of Vaccination, for it has been the special aim of our Society to collect and supply, year after year, the officials of the Local Government Board with particulars and proofs of the failures, mischiefs, and occasionally wholesale disasters attending the State-enforced operation. I can scarcely imagine a more pain fully interesting document than a catalogue of such cases as have been supplied by our indefatigable secretary, Mr. Young. One of our latest com munications to the State Department has been to furnish both the Prime Minister and the President of the Local Government Board with the disclosures of the house-to-house Vaccination Census,* which has now been made in seventy * Before these Censuses were made, the supporters of Vaccination asserted with endless iteration that anti-vaccinators were an insignificant minority composed of "ignorant and obstinate" people, who in the words of the Daily News were running amuck against the scientific tendencies of the age. Since these returns have been issued, our opponents have entirely changed front, and now assert that the democracy is utterly incompetent to form an opinion on a question like Vaccination. This opinion is not generally allowed. In a leading article, The Spectator for May 15th, 1886, says:— "It may freely be admitted that on matters fit for popular and partly emotional judgment, and many matters are fit for such judgment, —the instincts of a political people are often considerably in advance of the educated judgment of select classes." The cases of injury and death, reported by the signatories to the census papers, are believed to be a mere fraction of the disasters arising from the operation. I have personally made inquiries in hundreds of towns and villages in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, as well as on the Continent, the United States of America, the Dominion of A Householders Census. 15 cities, towns, villages, and districts in the United Kingdom, every division being represented with the exception of the Eastern Counties ; and as we have several delegates from that part of the country with us this evening, I take this oppor tunity of respectfully inviting them to see that this important vacuum is supplied, so that we may know what all England thinks upon this momentous subject. These returns show that over 80 per cent, of their population disapprove of Compulsory Vaccination, and that over 70 per cent, have no faith whatever in the efficacy of Jenner's prescription. It appears that 430 deaths and over 2,000 cases of injury are reported by the signatories to the census papers, which they allege of their own experience to be due to Vaccination ; and all these witnesses, it should be noted, are responsible householders. But although the Government are in possession of Canada, and many other places, and have never inquired without hearing of such cases from eye witnesses, —generally speaking the Mr. John Pickering, F.R.G.S., F.S.S., says:—"For 34 years I have been a close and obseiTant student of the Vaccination Question, parents of the injured children. and in particular upon that phase of it which refers to the influence of Vaccination upon the mortality of the people. It is my decided opinion that Vaccination is the direct cause of 50,000 deaths per annum in this country ; that is, in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. I am fully aware of the importance and responsibility of the statement above recorded, and if opportunity is given, such as a Second Inquiry, or a Royal Commission, I shall seek to testify in detail as to my reasons for such opinion. A Vaccine Disaster Record, containing upwards of four hundred fatal cases caused by Vaccination from 1855 to 1883, was pubhshed in 1885 by Mr. Thomas Bakek, Barrister-at-Lavv, the continued edition of which to date has been called for. The Registrar General's Returns, No. 76, Sess. I, 1880; and 392, Sess. 2, 1880, are demonstrative of the greatly increased death-rate among infants under one year of age, by inoculable diseases. i6 Vaccine Fatalities. this incriminating evidence, they refuse to warn the public against the dangers of Vaccination, to appoint a Royal Commission of Inquiry, to give rehef to conscientious and upright citizens who object to Vaccination, and, lastly, to accede to our recent request to receive a deputation, so that the proofs in our possession of the failures and evils of the system may be laid before them. What is the fair inference to be drawn from these unreasonable refusals of Government after Government to submit the theories of their State doctors to investigation ? Is it not that the Government and permanent officials are internally conscious that they have no case, and that an impartially-conducted tribunal would scatter to the winds the baseless assumptions, the bogus statistics, and the miserable subterfuges upon which the Vaccination system is founded and sustained ? Official Acknowledgments of Vaccine Fatalities. During the past five years there have been 290 deaths returned by the Registrar- General * as due to official Vaccination, and the permanent * And these Official Returns disclose but an infinitesimal portion of the fatalities due to Vaccination by reason of the custom, (ail but universal in England and Wales and quite general in Scotland,) to certify such deaths to the secondary, instead of the primaiy cause. Dr. J. Garth Wilkinson, whose attention for the last twenty years has been seriously directed to the subject, says : " Hundreds of cases are recorded in which the deaths of infants, \vho were healthy up to the Iiour of Vaccination, followed, after greater The Norivich Disaster. 17 officials are apparently quite content that the State should make an annual sacrifice of about sixty lives, in order that the "blessings" of Vaccination may be continued. The parents of these sacrificed children, most of whom only succumb after months of shocking torture, take a different view of the matter, and after the Norwich inquiry,* (Monday, November 27th, 1882,) into the deaths of four children and the serious injury to five others, the St. James's Gazette, a paper which cannot be accused of a leaning towards fanaticism, forcibly puts the case thus : " Compulsory Vaccination does undoubtedly " involve a great interference with the rights of or lesser periods of suffering, often honible suffering, the insertion of vaccine ; the suffering generally dating from the operation, and disease steadily advancing therefrom. The vaccinating doctors for the most part deny all connection between the Vaccination and the death, and influence coroners' juries to pronounce death from some other cause. The difficulty is that the circumstantial witnesses of the death are only mothers, fathers, and relations, and their testimony is of no weight in scientific scales. Now, although any one or two of these, standing alone, might be casualties, and accounted for as accidental disease independent of Vaccination, yet if a clear thread of pathological symptoms runs through nearly all of them, and if one end of the thread is Vaccination and the other end death, then the interpretation of such cases becomes very important. The records may indeed be given without technical knowledge by poor uneducated people, or by 'rabid anti-vaccinators,' or by weeping childless mothers ; but a pathological thread once traced puts aside all ignorance, and shows that the mde accounts contain the fact and the truth. Sucli a thread does exist, and can be plainly followed in almost eveiy separate case." * R. H. Allnatt, M.D., writing in The Times, August 31st, 1882, concerning the Norwich disaster above referred to, says:—"Some of the vaccinators use real instruments of torture. Ivory points are driven into the flesh, and wounds ensue which becomes erysipelatous, and in the delicate constitutions of weakly children, fatal. A more serious disaster occurred at Misterton, near Gainsborough. 16 children were infected with vaccine erysipelas, of whoffi 6 died, —i<elurn No. 50, Sess. 187^. is The Case Fairly Stated. " parents over their children. It is only to be "justified by the advantage accruing to the " community, and by the certainty that it " does no harm to the child. But if the " practice does harm to a certain per centage " of children, the whole situation is changed. " The State must not take a toll of children's " lives for the benefit of other children. The " argument is the same, if for killing we " substitute infecting with any dangerous or " repulsive disease. It is one thing to say, " 'whether you like it or not, you should subject " your child to an operation which can only " do it good,' and another to say, 'whether " you like it or not, you should subject your child "to an operation which may cause its death or " infect it with lasting disease.'" This is the case as fairly stated from the vaccinator's point of view, and you will see that the excuse entirely fails, for these fatalities and mischiefs have been coincident with the practice from its earliest origin. For my own part, however, I believe that the State has no right to encroach upon parental responsibility, or to impose either religious or medical dogmas upon the people of this country on any pretence whatever."^" * Mr. Herbert Spencer, says:—"The function of liberalism in the past, was that of putting a limit to the power of Kings. The function of true liberalism in the future, will be that of putting a limit to the power of Failiaraent."— Contemporary Review, July, 1884. An Unequal Law. 19 The Inequity of the Law, It is not denied, even by our opponents, that the Vaccination Law is most inequitable, and it is beheved that there are between two and three hundred Members of ParHament who have admitted that it ought to be amended ; and although in my judgment no amendment would render it tolerable, it is only reasonable that this side of the case should be brought before your notice. Dr. Johnson said, 100 years ago, that "no scheme of policy has in any country yet brought the rich and poor on equal terms into courts of judicature." And what was true a century ago is doubly true now in respect to Vaccination. It is just ten years since Mr. Gladstone, in the House of Commons, used these words : "The great inequality of the law as it stands, " is the strongest reason for doing what we can " to mitigate its severity. The cumulative " penalties are a trifle to wealthy men, but to " the poor they are of a crushing character. " Even if we reduce the penalties to a limited " amount they will, under all the circumstances, " be a much severer charge to the poor man than " to the rich." Let us see how the case stands. Those who are familiar with the operations of the law are aware that, as a rule, wealthy opponents of Vaccination are either not interfered with at all 1 20 Its Cruelty towards the PooY. or, at most, are only called upon to pay a single penalty. I am personally acquainted with entire families occupying residences in fashionable dis tricts of the metropolis, none of whom are vaccinated, nor have they ever been prosecuted. Amongst these are families of medical practi tioners, influential lawyers, prosperous merchants, and a member of Parliament. But the defence less poor, as is well known, are harassed with threatening notices, summoned again and again before the police-courts as malefactors, and reduced to fly like hunted fugitive slaves from one parish to another, in order to save their children from the dangers of the state-enforced operation. It has often been my privilege to stand between these unfortunate victims and the officers of the law, lest they should be ruined with repeated penalties, their little households stripped of furniture, or their persons subjected to the torture of the plank-bed in prison, and other ignominious punishments.* * Charles Washington Nye, watchmaker of Chatham, having had two children killed by Vaccination, has preserved the others through several smallpox epidemics, at the price of six imprisonments (in addition to previous fines) in one of which his delicate hands were made to bleed by wheeling stones during a month's hard labour. Mr. William Young, of London, whose opportunities of knowing the evils of Vaccination and the cruelty of the law are unusual, distinctly describes, in The Vaccination Inquirer, what anti-vaccinators have suffered, as follows : Exile—many having left the country to avoid repeated prosecutions. Itnprisonmenis, frequently repeated, and often accompanied with hard labour. Loss of Goods and Furniture by distraint Exclusion of their children from the public schools, and later in life from situations in various capacities, unless submitting to re-vaccination. Its Cruelty towards the Poor. 1 1 Then, again, the rite of Vaccination is altogether a different matter with the poor, than with well to-do families acting under the advice of a con scientious medical practitioner, who, as a rule. Fines repeated twenty and thirty times, and amounting, with costs, in some cases to £<y} and more. Instills from the Magisterial Bench, with denial of justice—1st, in denial of hearing of "a reasonable excuse;" 2nd, in rejection of legal certificates of unfitness signed by qualified medical practitioners. Told by prison chaplains that the voice of an anii-vaccinator's conscience is "the voice of the devil." Hair Cropped, and other personal indignities. Marched handcuffed to gaol, followed by the plank bed which ought to be reserved for felons. The following is a recent specimen, in the FINES & COSTS IMPOSED ON CHARLES HAYWARD. On the 3rd July, 1878, Joseph Stavely, of Bingley, Yorkshire, was convicted for non-vaccination , and fined twenty shillings and costs, or on delau t, fourteen days imprisonment with hard labour. On aiTiving at the gaol he was taken to a room naked, and had to sit for twenty minutes m that state until his hair and beard were cropped. He was kept at oakum picking for ten hours each day. Mothers near their confinement have been obliged to pawn their clothes, and the clothing of their expected infants, their wedding rings, and the sewing machme-which has been the sole means of a wifl's earnings aunng her husband's imprisonment. One poor woman, Mary Clark, of lithI'her than subject it to the The Risks of Public Vacchiation. only recommends a single puncture with carefully selected lymph. The poor, however, must submit to have the operation performed upon their helpless children at the crowded Vaccination stations in all weathers, in a most perfunctory manner, with lymph often reeking (if medical testimony is to be trusted) with scrofulous and syphilitic contaminations,-^ against the mischiefs A public vaccinator, Mr. J. G. Gerrans, M. R.C.S., wrote to The Lancet, claiming for more stringent enforcement of the Vaccination Acts, and reported his own zeal as follows : —" I have one of the largest Vaccinations in London, derived from a densely populated neighbourhood, and which I look closely after, but though I hunt them like a blood-hound on the murderer's trail, I am often thrown out." * At the Social Science Congress, held at Bristol in 1869, Mr. Alfred Haviland, M.R.C.S., in a paper on "The geographical distribution of scrofula in England and Wales, and its relation to general health and Vaccination, " summed up his conclusions as follows: 1. That Vaccination is perilous to infant and adult life when performed in scrofulous districts ; as, from the large amount of stmmous matter (having frequently its origin in syphilis, and often associated with it) disseminated throughout the population, it is impossible to ensure that the lymph shall be free from other organic poisons, which, if not immediately, do most assuredly remotely, affect those who receive contaminated matter into their systems. 2. That the Compulsoiy Vaccination Act renders indiscriminate inoculation of cowpox, associated with scrofula and syphilis, inevitable in large communities ; and that it is a hardship that iJiose who cannot afford to pay for care in the selection of matter for their children, should be imprisoned to satisfy a law which, whilst it pretends to aim at staying one plague, runs the risk of disseminating others of a more fearful and permanent character. 3. That the Compulsory Vaccination Act ought to be at once repealed, and that the natural history of smallpox and other diseases should be carefully studied, and their geographical distribution throughout the countiy investigated, as a first step towards the solution of the difficult problems involved in the inquiry. The Medical Times for September 26th, 1885, referring to the German Vaccination Commission, says, "That when the Act of 1874 was passed, neither the medical profession nor educated persons generally apprehended any danger of the communication of syphilis or risks of erysipelas, but the most lamentable accidents from time to time have followed. Dr. LoTZ has collected no fewer than fifty separate cases affecting in all seven hundred and fifty individuals, and as solitary instances of syphilisation are less easy of proof, the real number is probably much greater." . . . "As regards syphilis, one case brought to the notice of the German Commissioners No Redress Obtainable. 23 of which there is no compensation or redress. A few weeks ago, a member of Parliament told me in the lobby of the House that he was absolutely certain that not one out of 670 members of Parliament would consent to have his own child incur the well-known perils incident to public Vaccination. Why, then, should the poor in this democratic age be so cruelly and inequitably dealt with ? I have no hesitation in saying that if the medical profession, who have been instrumental in forging these fetters around the necks of people ; the members of Parliament, who, without previous investigation as to its utility or necessity, have been led to pass this obnoxious law ; the magis trates, who are called upon to administer it ; and the pro-vaccinal journalists, who feel it their duty is most instructive. It is commonly believed that if a child has been so far cured as to present no external evidence of disease, and the vesicles run a perfectly normal course, no harm can result from employing it as a vaccinifer. But at Lebus, fifteen female scholars were syphilised by Vaccination from a child whose skin was perfectly clear, and in whom The medical Tit?ies and Gazette, February 1st, 1873, writes : —"It is not the vesicles on the eighth day presented a normal appearance." fair to subject healthy infants to the risk of Vaccination from others which, though healthy at the time, may subsequently shew signs of inherited taint. It is not fair to subject people's children to the risks such as those which Vaccination-syphilis implies, with no alternative save to go to prison. Mr. Herbert Spencer, speaking of the deplorable and increasing ill-health of the rising generation, thus expresses himself:—"We are not certain that the propagation of subdued forms of constitutional disease through the agency of Vaccination is not a part-cause. Sundiy facts in pathology suggest the inference that when the system of a vaccinated child is excreting the vaccine virus by means of pustules, it will tend also to excrete through such pustules other morbific matters ; especially if these morbific matters are of a kind ordinarily got rid of by the skin, as are some of the worst of them. Hence it is very possible,—probable even,—that a child with a constitutional taint, too slight to shew itself in visible disease, may, through the medium of vitiated vaccine lymph taken from it, convey a like constitutional taint to other children, and these to othtrs."—Education, p. 181. 1881. 24 Failure of Compulsion. to defend it, were compelled to have their own children incur the risks of public Vaccination, particularly in large towns, such a storm of righteous opposition would be awakened from one end of the kingdom to the other, that the entire system of State Vaccination, which is now tottering to its fall, would crumble to pieces amidst the opprobrium and indignation of the people. The Failure of Compulsion. Those who have studied the results of the compulsory law are aware that, so far from affording any protection against either sporadic or epidemic smallpox . Vaccination has proved a miserable and humiliating failure, and it would not be difficult to prove this by admissions made in the columns of medical journals. As, however, this subject will probably be dealt with by other speakers presently, I will confine myself to a few simple facts. The Metropolitan Asylums * The Select Committee of the House of Commons, instituted to amongst other things: —"That the cowpox affords a very great protection inquire into the operation of the Vaccination Act of 1867, reported against an attack of smallpox ; and an almost absolute protection against death from that disease." This report was dated 23rd May, 1871, but in less than two months from this comforting prediction of "almost of 15th July, 1871, delivers itself thus : —"The deaths from smallpox have absolute protection," one of the strongest partisan journalsThe Lancet assumed the proportions of a plague. Over 10,000 lives have been sacrificed during the past year in England and Wales. In London 5,641 deaths have occurred since Christmas. Of 9,392 patients in the London smallpox Hospitals, no less than 6,854 had been vaccinated—nearly 73 per cent. Taking the mortality at 175 per cent, of those attacked, and the deaths this year in the whole country at 10,000, it will] follow that more than 122,000 vaccinated persons have suffered from smallpox ! This is an alarming state of things. Can we p-eatly wonder thai th( Failure of CompiUsio7i. 25 Board record in their last report the admission of 36,000 vaccinated smallpox cases since the year 1870, and these constitute 36,000 refutations of the Jennerian protective theory. It would be interesting to inquire, whether any possible number of failures would induce our opponents to admit the delusive nature of their infallible remedy. At a meeting of the Board, held in February, 1886, and reported in the Times newspaper, the chairman, Sir E. H. Currie, recommended oppoiietils of Vaccination shoicld point to such statistics as an evidence of the failttre of the system ? It is necessary to speak plainly on this important matter. " This was eighteen years after the imposition of a law, which its promoters promised, (on the assumed unanimous opinion of the entire medical profession,) would prove an infallible safeguard to all who should undergo the operation. There is probably no town in England where Vaccination has been more universally performed than in Liverpool. Here there are no for July 5lh, 1884, reports : —"The epidemic of smallpox, which has for anti-vaccination Leagues, and the press refuses discussion. The Lancet some time been prevalent at Liverpool, has now attained alarming dimensions. Traffic, except for residents, is in certain streets suspended, and the public institutions for the reception of smallpox patients are full to overflowing. " Per contra : —In Leicester during the fourteen years, 1873-86, 20 deaths only were registered from smallpox. In Keighley (which includes Bingley) during the same period Vwo smallpox deaths The Metropolitan for iMarch 5th, 1881, says : —"We know of no place were registered in 1885, and not one in any of the other ten years. where the Vaccination Laws are better administered than in the Melropolis, yet it is in London that smallpox abounds." The Medical Officer of Health for Taunton reported that in 1885, of 171 smallpox patients admitted into the Sanitary Hospital, 169 had been vaccinated, and 24 died. To secure immunity for the future, re-vaccination has been loudly called for. How this would operate may be estimated by the fact shewn in Parliamentary Return, 433 Sess. 1877, table 17, that of 80,000 smallpox deaths in certain districts during 18 years of enforced vaccination, 43,000 were under five years old—or seven years before the age recommended for re-vaccination. "It has been observed that secondary attacks of smallpox are not unusual, and that smallpox after Vaccination very frequently occurs. Instances of the latter kind indeed are so often met with as to lead to the belief that vaccinia gradually loses its protective influence on the system."Erasmus Wilson, Diseases of the Skin, pp. 1,15, 26 smallpox Epidemics Predicted. an appropriation of ^116,000 for additional smallpox hospital accommodation, which shows that he considers the extinction of smallpox by means of Vaccination to be a complete delusion. He said : " As sure as you are in this room there is certain to be a smallpox epidemic in the metropolis at no distant date. It always comes round with the greatest regularity. The last one cost the rate-payers a million of money, and I am convinced it will be less expensive if we make this provision." And, referring to this proposal, The Lancet for February 20th, 1886, writes: "We fully sympathise with the desire of the managers not to delay the steps which must be taken to meet the exigencies of the next epidemic." So, in return for all this coercive injustice and this wasteful expenditure of the public money, we are left absolutely by the vaccine prophets without consolation and without hope for the future. Growth of the Opposition. These exasperating laws, which are a terror to honest men, were enacted without the knowledge of the people, and, as already stated, without previous inquiry, and they afford a powerful illustration of how Parliament may, for lack of vigilance on the part of our citizens, become the The Growing Resistance. 27 grave, instead of the guardian, of our liberties. The Vaccination Laws are alien to all the best traditions of our race, and they have often been put in force with reckless and abominable cruelty. When the Bill of 1867 * was debated in the House, both Liberal and Conservative statesmen prophesied that the people would kick against a measure which was fostered by the suppression of all incriminating facts known to exist against the practice. And let me say that it is highly creditable to Englishmen that they have done so, as it shows that their passionate love of liberty is not yet extinguished ; and this opposition has developed, until in many places it approaches to the dimensions of an insurrection. Within the past ten years there have been about 30,000 prosecutions of upright and law-abiding citizens, and 25,000 convictions, and the last return of judicial statistics (for 1886), records 2,806 prosecutions and 2,400 convictions, and of these 922 honest parents were subjected to the spoiling of their goods, or to imprisonment, rather than purchase immunity at the risk of injuring the health or endangering the lives of their children. In the town of Dewsbury there are 15,000 unvaccinated children, and the law * Sir Thomas Chambers, now Recorder of the City of London, predicted that if the Bill was passed, an agitation would be set on foot which would not cease until the law was entirely repealed. This prediction is in a fair way of realisation. Yet those who testified in favor of Compulsoiy Vaccination before the Vaccination Committee of 1 871 predicted that the opposition to Vaccination would die out in two years' 28 Her Majesty's jubilee. is practically a dead letter. In Leicester there are over 20,000 unvaccinated children, and the number is augmenting at the rate of over 800 every three months. In Keighley 95 per cent, of the parents are opposed alike to Vaccination and compulsion. In Bingley, Falmouth, Gloucester, Leicester, Keighley, and Oldham, the people, by means of local option in the election of anti-vaccination Guardians, have already liberated themselves from this medical tyranny, and what we now demand, in the name of this large assembly, which contains delegates from many parts of England, is that the partial freedom won by the sacrifice and unbending devotion to principle by these patriotic citizens in the towns I have mentioned, shall by Parliament be made universal throughout the land. One of the exciting topics of the day is the appropriate celebration of the fiftieth year of Her Majesty's reign. We find in the fifth chapter of Leviticus, and the tenth verse, a mode of procedure worthy of imitation by the rulers of this commonwealth:—"And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land, and unto all the inhabitants of it, and it shall be a jubilee unto you." Under this ordinance every slave of Hebrew birth recovered his freedom, and all alienated land reverted to its orieinal owner. For the enslaved Hebrew had parted with his inheritance for a livelihood, and had understood and ratified the conditional A Practical Suggestion. 29 compact. But the compulsory sufferers of our island are children ; who are under the yoke, not of the parent but of a department of the Government ; and this department is composed of those whose utterances on our question are oracles, and whose decisions are placed high above Royal Commissions of Inquiry, and shrouded in a veil of sanctity inaccessible alike to reason and to proof I therefore venture to suggest that, in place of promoting the erection of costly edifices, our Parliamentary representa tives should be urged to follow the old paths, and, rising superior to party considerations, to promote the restoration of ancient intellectual freedom by the entire repeal of this obnoxious law. In this way they would be carrying out the divine behests ; they would be undoing the heavy burdens ; they would be breaking the yoke of an intolerable medical usurpation, and proclaiming perpetual emancipation to a long suffering and much-injured people. APPENDIX. From Mr. ISAAC HOLDEN, M.P. House of Commons, April 29, 1887. Dear Sir,—I am sorry I cannot promise to attend your meeting on May 11, although I so strongly sympathise with your object. I hope the meeting may be a good one. Have you yet issued a new edition of Dr. A. Russel Wallace's book ? I think it unanswerable ; and am glad to say that such also is the opinion of Mr. GLADSTONE, who has read it, and who thinks that compulsory Vaccination is proved by Dr. Wallace to be unjustifiable, and that it cannot be long maintained. Yours truly, ISAAC HOLDEN. The Jollowing letter from the pen of the distingtiished naturalist, Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace, was received by the President of the London Society previous to the issue of "Forty-Five Years Registration Statistics." " Like many other people, till a few years back, I had not a doubt as to the efficacy of Vaccination. I accepted it blindly as one of the established facts of science. Having been led to look into the evidence on the subject, I was first startled by the discrepancy of the statistics of smallpox mortality with the Vaccination theory, and on further inquiry I was amazed to find that the evidence in favour of Vaccination was of the most shadowy kind, while there was good reason to believe that it was itself a cause of disease of the most serious nature. I have also been struck by the (apparent) want of honesty in the defenders of Vaccination, in repeating over and over again statements which are not true, and in actually falsifying the records of smallpox mortality by entering all doubtful cases as 32 Appendix. ' unvaccinated.' I have no doubt whatever that any unprejudiced person who will investigate the evidence on both sides for himself, will arrive at the same conclusion as I have done—that to enforce on unwilling parents a surgical operation which they honestly believe to be injurious, and as to the efficacy of which there is so great a diversity of opinion, even among medical men, is a gross infraction of personal liberty entirely unjustified by any proved beneficial results." MEDICAL DEATH CERTIFICATES AND VACCINATION. The Registrar General's returns cannot be derived from other than official sources, but the value of these in estimating the precise number of deaths from Vaccination, may be inferred from the following passage in Mr. Henry May's paper, read before the Aston Medical Society in 1873, and given in The Birmingham Medical Review, January 1874, vol. iii. pp. 34-35. "In certificates given by us voluntarily, and to which the public have access, it is scarcely to be expected that a medical man will give opinions which may tell against or reflect upon himself in any way, or which are likely to cause annoyance or injury to the survivors. In such cases he will most likely tell the truth, but not the whole truth, and assign some prominent symptom of disease as the cause of death." "As instances of cases which may tell against the medical man himself, I will mention erysipelas from Vaccination, and puerperal fever. A death from the first cause occured not long ago in my practise, and though I had not vaccinated the child, yet, in my desire to preserve Vaccination from reproach, I omitted all mention of it from my certificate of death." VACCINATION IN THEORY, BUT NOT IN PRACTICE. " No properly vaccinated country can suffer from an epidemic of smallpox. Properly-performed infantile Vaccination, duly renewed at puberty, will virtually extinguish smallpox as a fatal disease among such populations as have recourse to it." " Against this one preventible disease (smallpox), England is now employing with systematic efficiency, and with success Appendix. 33 which is in constant increase, those happily adequate means of resistance which the genius of an EngHsh surgeon first added to the resources of mankind."John Simon, Medical Officer of the Privy Council, Official Report, 1875. " The whole human race ... is indebted to Dr. Jenner's happy discovery and acute researches for an unspeakable boon and blessing. . . . Where Vaccination is, there the contagion of smallpox need never come."—Sir Thomas Watson, M.D., 1878. VACCINATION IN PRACTICE, BUT NOT IN THEORY.

The Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, appointed to inquire into and report upon the advisability or otherwise of amending the law relating to Vaccination, have the honor to report to your Honorable House as follows : I.—Your Committee have held five meetings, and have examined, in all, fourteen witnesses, of whom six were public vaccinators, and six leading metropolitan medical practitioners. A list of questions was also transmitted to prominent medical men in Ballarat, Geelong, and Sandhurst, and the replies received from them appear in a tabulated form in appendix B. 34 Appendix. 2. —Your Committee find that the opinions expressed by the various medical men, are so conflicting and contradictory on many points, as to render their testimony of Httle practical value. On the question of re-vaccination, for example, some stated that it was not necessary, others that it should take place every seven years, whilst others again would extend the period to fourteen years. There was the same diversity of opinion with regard to the number of punctures or incisions to be made on the arm. One witness affirmed that the operation would be of little efficacy unless four punctures were made, and suggested that all vaccinators should be compelled to make that number. Another witness considered one cicatrix sufficient, and a third thought it would be better left to the discretion of the medical man, as some children were not strong enough to bear four marks. There was, however, a consensus of opinion that infants should not be vaccinated during the months of January and February, as the heat at that period of the year is very trying to children in this colony. Other valuable and useful suggestions were made to your Committee, of which the most important was the appointment of an Inspector of Vaccination. 3.—Greater unanimity prevailed on the question of the com munication of extraneous diseases, such as syphilis and scrofula by Vaccination, although some of the witnesses maintained that there would be no liability to such transmission unless blood were drawn during the operation. Dr. Beaney and Dr. Sparling, however, mentioned instances that came under their observation of syphilis and erysipelas being communicated to children from purely colorless vaccine matter which contained no trace of blood. 4. —In view of this fact, and to allay any alarm in the public mind, there was a general expression of opinion that the system of animal Vaccination, at present practised with such good results on the Continent of Europe, should be tried here. Your Com mittee, therefore, would recommend that a Bill be brought in to amend the present Vaccination Act, in order to have depots established for supplying animal lymph from young heifers and discontinuing the practice of Vaccination during the months of January and February. Committee-Room, (House of Parliament,) Melbourne. i^rd March, 1881. In the same year, the Legislative Council of New South Wales, comprising Sir HENRY Parkes, K.C.M.G., Sir JOHN Appendix. 35 Robertson, K.C.M.G., The Hon. James Watson, The Hon. Robert Wisdom, The Hon. James Hoskins, The Hon. John Lackey, Sir George Innes, Knt., The Hon. P'rancis Bathurst SUTTOR, formed themselves into a Committee to investigate the results of Vaccination. Five sittings were held and fifteen medi cal practitioners were examined, beginning the 15th September, 1 88 1. The minutes were published by the Colonial Government of the Colony, with a view to initiating compulsory legislation, but The Sydney Herald said, they were found to be so contra dictory on all elementary data, that nothing was attempted in this direction. THE TWO CREEDS. By H. D. Dudgeon. The problem of suppressing epidemic disease has caused two principles of action to stand prominently before the country in direct opposition to each other. One is the reduction of zymotic complaints by their respective Vaccinations, Jennerian or Pasteurian ; the other is their repression by municipal cleanliness. The vaccine theoiy is changeable and uncertain, and its supporters seem content to leave it in its original shroud. They find it unwise to particularize, and their proffered blessings are clouded in generalities. We need expect no reply when we ask,—What are the items of the claim made on behalf of the cowpox ? What will it do for the individual who submits to the operation .? Is the protection personal, or (as the Germans now say) collective .? If personal, how can a protected person become a victim to the smallpox 1 If collective, is the protection shared equally or unequally among the recipients 1 If shared equally, why does the asserted difference of risk between the families of vaccinators and anti-vaccinators fail to exhibit itself? If shared unequally, what is it that governs the inequality? We are also told that the vaccinated are thirty-seven times safer than the unvaccinated. Does this mean, that the vaccinated population of the dingiest and most neglected slums and rookeries, are thirty-seven times safer than an equal population of un vaccinated persons living in a cleanly and open town ? If so, where is the proof? If not, what does it mean ? A curious part of the vaccine mystery is the gradual cessation of the power of the operation, the duration of the protection being said to be not more than ten years on the average, and even during this short period the security is openly admitted to be gradually dwindling away. 36 Appendix, Our novel system of State medicine is reserved when inquiries are made. It can only be justified by a resort to State infallibility. Were State doctoring explicit, it would cease to be infallible an explicit infallibility would be incapable of changing its front. And vaccinal writers in their dogmatic statements ought to make their line of argument coherent and consistent. As matters stand, it is difficult enough to ascertain their real demands upon our faith or our credulity. Apparently the modern vaccine creed under its latest changes may be thus particularized : 1. —An attack of smallpox was the universal destiny, till Jenner appeared and saved those whose successful Vaccination had successfully protected them. 2. —smallpox could formerly originate, but can now only be propagated from person to person. 3.—Cleanliness and hygienic precautions, domestic or muni cipal, exert no practical influence over it : the palace is as liable as the wigwam : the anti-vaccinator is powerless against it : the only preventive, and the only mitigator, is Vaccination. 4. —A mitigated case in a vaccinated person is due to the number and quality of the Vaccination marks, but in an un vaccinated person it is due to other causes. 5. —Lymph from the calf is more "pure" than lymph from other sources. 6. — Vaccination properly administered from cow, calf, or human being, can convey no disease but cowpox. Those who hold this opinion, ought to be the sole judges in cases of alleged transmission of family diseases. 7.—The results of Vaccination in the general population, ought to be judged by the statistics or figures of its advocates. 8. —Vaccinators are a mild and suffering race, who simply ask for legal power to vaccinate and re-vaccinate friend and foe ad libitum, at the expense and risk of the individual or the public. 9.—Anti-vaccinators are people who, when trodden upon, are apt to " let angry passions rise." The anti-vaccine creed is less intolerant, and may be thus displayed : 1.—smallpox is a filth disease, and may originate daily in the foul haunts where dirt and degradation reign. 2. —The attack is mild or severe according to the amount or intensity of the surrounding impurities to which the sufferer is Appendix. 37 or has been, exposed, and the strength of his constitutional powers of resistance. 3. —Sanitation is better than Vaccination. 4—Anti-vaccinators, by reason of their avoidance of Jennerian transmitted disease, and their active belief in sanitary laws, are less liable than vaccinating families to the attacks of the zymotic or filth diseases throughout life. 5. —Statistical comparisons ought to be made between vac cinators and anti-vaccinators, and not between the strong and the weakly of vaccinating families. THE ALLEGED SECURITY OF RE-VACCINATED HOSPITAL NURSES. This famous statistical cornerstone of vaccine defence was promulgated in the Select Committee on Vaccination in 1871, by Mr. Marson, the resident Surgeon of the Highgate smallpox Hospital. He said to the Committee, "In the 35 years during which I have been at the smallpox Hospital, I have never had a nurse or a servant the whole time who has taken smallpox there. I re-vaccinate them when they come there, and they never have smallpox, although they are exposed to infection every day." Nine questions were immediately put to Mr. Marson and answered, and a member of the Committee then asked him, " Have any of the nurses in your Hospital had smallpox before they were engaged as nurses " Mr. Marson replied, " Some of them." Being then asked, " And still you re-vaccinate them when they come in?" Mr, MARSON replied,
