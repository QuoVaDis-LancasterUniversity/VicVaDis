WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT VACCINATION ?  Iy a previous article in the January number of the WESTMINSTER REVIEW, on "' Vaccination by Act of Parliament," the reasons were cited which induced our Legislature to pass a law making vaccination universal and obligatory, and it was shown how completely the promises of immunity from smallpox, alleged to be conferred by it, and its benign character, were falsified by nearly ninety years' ex- perience. In the present article it is proposed to present some further examples of the disastrous consequences arising from the practice, and to expose some of the sophistries and fallacies by which it is supported.  The following medically certified deaths of infants under one year old are recorded by the Registrar-General for England, under the head of " Cowpox and Other Effects of Vaccination," which appear for the first time in the return of 1881 :-  Year.

An important question arises as to how far these figures may be considered to represent the totality of deaths resulting from the State-enforced ordinance. Some time ago, I was dining with a medical man who had occupied the position of public vaccinator in a large Metropolitan parish for many years, when the question of vaccination came up for discussion. I said: '' Doctor, how is it that you relinquished the practice of vaccination?" To which he promptly replied: '"' Because I killed so many." No inquests were held, nor was vaccination specified in the certificates of death sent to the Registrar-General. At this time there appears to have existed in England a general understanding that deaths from vacci- nation were not on any account to he acknowledged,' and from personal inquiries made in various parts of Scotland in 1886, I gather that a similar belief and practice still prevails in that country. Deaths from vaccination have been reported from time to time from Scotland, but no inquiry by the Procurator-Fiscal into the cause of such deaths is on record, nor has any instance of a medi- cally certified death from vaccination, so far as I am aware, been registered.?  Other medical coroners have not unfrequently refused to hold inquests on children alleged to be killed by vaccination, and cases are on record where this refusal has been persisted in, notwithstanding the receipt of numerously signed requisitions.' It has been found advisable, therefore, in many places where candidates offer themselves for this office, to inquire previously whether, if elected, they are willing to hold inquests on vaccination cases. But even when such inquests are reluctantly granted, the truth is not always easily elicited. The parents of the slain children shrink from the publicity of a coroner's jury, and are often too poor to pay for the services of a solicitor or for the attendance of the necessary witnesses,  The Bath Herald, November 12, 1885, records an inquest on a fatal vaccination case, where the coroner refused to allow the solicitor, Mr. F. D. Askey, who represented the parent, to appear, on the ground that he had no standing in the case. A misleading verdict was returned, and a public meeting was held at the Guildhall to denounce this glaring miscarriage of justice.  Medical coroners are almost always, if not invariably, strongly  1 Dr. Garth Wilkinson, who has devoted much study to this question, says that hundreds of children, healthy up to the hour of vaccination, are killed by the operation, but the vaccinating doctors for the most part deny all connection between vaccination and the death, and they influence coroners' juries to pronounce death as due to some other cause. ;  2 On July 19, 1869, an inquest was held on the child of Mr. Emery, and, on the jury bringing in a verdict, '' Died from erysipelas caused by vaccination," the coroner, Dr. Lankester, falsified it by returning, '' Death from misadventure." Dr. Lankester objected to hold inquests on children alleged to have died through vaccination (Vaccination Inquirer, September 1886. Vol. VIII.  3 Vaccination Tracts, by Dr. Garth Wilkinson and Mr. William Young, part iii. p. 7.           What is the Truth about Vaccination ? 189  biassed in favour of the practice, and their efforts to preserve  vaccination tion from reproach are supported by the testimony of medical experts from the Vaccination Department of the Local Government Board, some of whom carry loyalty to their profession to the length of refusing to recognize vaccination as even a possible cause of death, no matter what amount of evidence may be adduced at the inquiry.  Dr. Henry Stevens, a Government vaccine inspector, who is more frequently sent to investigate vaccine fatalities than any other official, says: '' I have seen more vaccination than perhaps any man, and I have never seen the least injury from the practice." And he affirms that the present system is as perfect as it can be made.  In 1886 the Rev. H. B. Finch, of Ryde, reported the cases of four children dead in a month after the operation, and six cases of injury, the facts of which he offered to substantiate by hundreds of respectable witnesses. Mr. Finch took pains to investigate these cases, and earnestly requested the President of the Local Government Board to institute an impartial public inquiry, which was refused. Dr. Stevens, having been sent down, no doubt reported as usual that the fatal issue had nothing to do with vaccination.'  The medical custom of defending vaccination @ outrance is by no means of recent origin. Jenner himself cautioned his professional brethren to be slow in reporting cases of smallpox after vaccination. The eminent ophthalmic surgeon, Mr. R. Brudenell Carter, F.R.C.S., writing to the Lancet, June 13, 1868, observes: '' I am quite aware that there is now a sort of common consent among medical writers to gloss over the evils that may be attendant upon vaccination for the sake of its greater and manifest benefits." In a fatal vaccination case at West Hartlepool, Dr. Swanwick stated that the death was "due to syphilis from inoculation," upon which the Lancet for August 21, 1881, says: "It is much to be regretted that medical men should lend themselves to the purposes of the anti-vaccination agitators;" and Dr. Greenwood, jun., in the Hospital Gazette, August 16, 1888, takes the editor to task for publishing particulars of a fatal case of re-vaccination, which he characteristically describes as '" anti-vaccination nonsense."  This common understanding is flagrantly exhibited in the form of death certificates in vaccination cases, and is no doubt more or less due to ignorance on the part of the public vaccinator as to what transpires after he has performed the operation. At an inquest held at Marylebone, Mr. George Allen, the public vaccinator, testified that he had been a vaccinator since he was fifteen years old, and had performed one hundred operations in aday. He had never seen a fatal case before, and knew nothing of the vaccinated children either before or  1 Vaccination Inquirer, April 1886     TA CR EPR          190 The Westminster Review.  after. In October 1876 an official inquiry' was made concerning the illnesses through vaccination of sixteen children in the Misterton district of the Gainsborough Union, of which six proved fatal, but no mention was made of vaccination in any of the death certificates. Of the four deaths at Norwich, the subject also of an official inquiry in 1882, only one was certified as being due to vaccination. It appeared that nine children were vaccinated in June by Dr. Guy, the public vaccinator ; of these four were dead of erysipelas within three weeks of the operation, and five were seriously ill from constitutional disease. Through the persistency of Mr. Peter A. Taylor and others, a Commission of Inquiry was granted by the Government, and the results reported in accordance with the facts. The medical chief at the Local Government Board, Dr. George Buchanan, was, however, extremely dissatisfied with the report, and added a curiously inconsequential memorandum to neutralize its disquieting effects, with a view to save the credit of the Jennerian ordinance.  Commenting on the official report, the St, James's Gazette of November 27, 1882, said :-  "That document is profoundly interesting to millions of poor people-so interesting, indeed, and so provoking, that if it does not lead straight to certain reforms in the process of vaccination as commonly carried on, it had better be carefully suppressed. Here we may learn officially how at Nor- wich four children died of erysipelas shortly after being vaccinated. They were all healthy before the operation ; there was nothing to make it pro- bable that the erysipelas was produced by any cause unconnected with vacci- nation. Now when we reflect on all this, and consider that what happened at Norwich has been happening in a greater or less degree all over the country for years, we shall see that the prejudice against vaccination has not been dealt with as tenderly as it deserves. Thousands of mothers com- plain that their babes were never the same after the operation had been performed. Their children did not die, but they drooped and pined, and their health was done for.. . . . The State must not take a toll of children's lives for the benefit of other children. The argument is the same if for killing we substitute infecting with any dangerous or repulsive disease."  The Morning Post says: '' There can be no reasonable doubt that these cases of erysipelas were due to vaccination. The lymph used was derived from healthy children, and the inspector's report practi- cally exonerates the public vaccinator from blame, either as regards selection of the lymph or performance of the operation."  In October 1883 three cases of fatal erysipelas occurred at Great Cornard, Suffolk, but here again no mention was made of the primary cause, vaccination, death being attributed to erysipelas only. It is no exaggeration to say that hundreds of isolated deaths have been reported during recent years by bereaved parents in the Press, and particulars in scores of cases have been sent to the President of the Local Government Board, without producing any effect upon that  1 Parliamentary Return 50, 1887, and Review of the Norwich Vaccination Inquiry,. by Dr. W. J. Collins, F.R.C.S,, Gold Medallist in Hygiene, &c.        What ts the Truth about Vaccination ? 191  department. A register of these fatal cases would be an instructive instrument for the information of Parliament at the next vaccination debate. From the records of some hundreds of cases before me, I will cite one which illustrates one of the methods in vogue with the medical profession for stifling unwelcome facts. Dr. Thomas Skinner thus describes the occurrence :-  "Tf physicians have any difficulty in the matter of drawing a simple logical conclusion, I give the following case :-' A young lady, aged fifteen, a charming girl, and dearly beloved by all who knew her, was vaccinated by myself with vaccine lymph, as pure as any. Her motherand the cook were vaccinated at the same time, and from the same tube. Eleven days after the operation, this blooming girl, who was in the best of health, died from nothing more or less than the simple operation of re-vaccination, to save her from a greater evil (sic)-smallpox. The coroner and others may blame the insalubrity of surroundings, the knocking off of scabs, and such like twaddle and make-believe ; but it is a sorry recompense, a precious poor consolation to a broken-hearted mother for the loss of her child.' In the case I have alluded to, the young lady belonged to one of the first families in this town; the salubrity of her abode-Prince's Park-was unquestion- able; and I anxiously examined the vesicle from day to day, during her illness. I can vouch for it, it was never broken in the slightest, and went its course as naturally as any vaccine vesicle I ever saw.in all my experience. I brought the case before the Medical Institution in this town. The meeting of members owned that the death was due entirely to vaccination, but they expressed a desire that it might not be made public. I have kept faith with them until now, when the love of truth compels me to proclaim it. Such cases are not so very rare. Sir Culling Eardley was another victim, and it is to be hoped that his mother and the insalubrity of his quarters were not to blame for the misadventure." 1  The Hospital Gazette, September 8, 1888, published the details of a fatal vaccination case at Brixton, London, entitled, '"' Another Victim of Vaccination," the cause of death being medically certified as due to marasmus, together with copy of a correspondence with the Registrar- General ; and Dr. R. H. 8. Carpenter, who investigated the facts, says that the death was evidently due to vaccination, and ought to have been so described in the death certificate, and adds that " this is by no means the first time complaint has been made to me of false certifi- cates having been given under similar cireumstances."  The following candid apology for this line of conduct is presented in the Medical Press and Circular, of January 10, 1883: " Let us not pretend to more virtue for medical men than for other classes of practitioners of similar social standing, and let us, therefore, not forget that a very numerous section of our profession will certainly not, if they can help it, do anything which will interfere with their own interests in practice; with such practitioners business is business."  Testimonies to an effect similar to that quoted from the Hospital  1 Liverpool Daily Post, October 25, 1876.                              192 The Westminster Review.  Gazette have of late been frequent. Dr. T. D. Nicholson, of Clifton, Bristol, in a letter to myself, writes, September 25, 1888 :-  "T have no doubt that there are numerous deaths due to vaccination which are put down to some secondary cause. In the first place it would be a condemnation to do otherwise, and secondly the vaccinator would be blamed for using bad matter, however careful he may have been in select- ing the lymph. Public vaccinators rarely see the children after the eighth day. Hence they see little harm resulting, and death from such a cause would never enter into their calculation."  Dr. John Stewart, of Perth, also writes to me, October 2, 1888: "J have no doubt the primary cause-vaccination-is often over- looked in many deaths of infants." The late Dr. William Hitchman, consulting surgeon to the Leeds Cancer Hospital, and for some years public vaccinator at Liverpool, says: ''There are hundreds killed yearly by it; the fact is, medical men dare not return vaccination in their certificates of death as the primary cause;" and he further declares that he has conducted post-mortem examinations on  vaccination tion cases in several towns where the verdict has been misleading.  Dr, Ewing Whittle writes to me, September 29: "I have long been fully aware that false certificates are continually given with the fraudulent intent of whitewashing vaccination through thick and thin." There are other reasons for this reticence concerning the evils of vaccination besides those already mentioned. Vaccination, as is well known, has been extolled as a masterpiece of scientific medical induction, and as " the greatest discovery in the history of medicine," and monuments have been erected to do honour to the discoverer as the most eminent amongst medical benefactors; and, further, the profession have singled out vaccination as the only prescription worthy to be universally enforced by legislative authority. It is obvious, therefore, that the prestige of the profession, no less than its interest, is closely associated with its perpetuation. To attack vaccination brings upon the heretic the reprobation of his medical confréres, and provokes a castigation from the medical journals, with the risk of being struck off the roll of physicians. Letters exposing the evils of the Jennerian cultus have from time to time appeared in the daily and weekly Press, but seldom without the writers being taken to task for their temerity in questioning the orthodox belief. Not long ago, I was talking to a physician and Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons on some recent fatal  vaccination tion cases which he had examined. The facts were incontestible, and on taking leave, I said, '' Doctor, why, in the interests of humanity, don't you write to the Times and to the medical journals, describing your experience?" He answered, "To do what you ask would be equivalent to professional suicide." Those medical practitioners who have so far spoken openly and fearlessly in the Press, are usually men advanced in life, with assured positions, or    What is the Truth about Vaccination? 193  men of light and leading, and of courage and conviction. From the foregoing testimonies, it would seem that the official list of deaths from ''Cowpox and Other Effects of Vaccination" furnishes no satisfactory clue to the number of vaccination fatalities, and we now proceed to consult other sources of information.  The recent issue of Mr. Channing's Parliamentary Return of deaths of infants under one year per million of births (No. 372), dated August 13, 1888, in continuation of a Parliamentary Paper, No. 392, Sess. 2, 1880, shows that some adverse cause is at work powerful enough to neutralize, so far as infants under one year of age are concerned, the ameliorating effects of modern sanitation exhibited in a generally diminishing death-rate. Of four causes of death, admittedly inoculable, the mortality in 1847, as shown by Return No. 392 for infants under one year per million of births, was registered as follows :-  Syphilis, 472; scrofula, 335; tabes mesenterica, 3008 ; skin dis- ease, 156. These infantile diseases have gradually increased, and this new return enables us to give the annual average during the quinquennial period 1882-6 as follows :-  Syphilis, 1901 ; scrofula, 1268 ; tabes mesenterica, 4516 ; skin dis- ease, 488. :  This return shows that there has been a large diminution in the mortality from smallpox. During the six years 1847-53, the pro- portion of smallpox deaths among children under five to total of all ages from that cause was about two-thirds. From 1878 to 1886 it was less than one-fourth. But the enormous increase of deaths by inoculable diseases shows at what cost this immunity has been obtained. If children die of inoculated syphilis or scrofula, they will not die of smallpox. It is admitted that cowpox lowers the vitality of infants, and, in the opinion of many experienced physicians, renders them susceptible to other diseases, such as bronchitis, which these returns show has increased from 4641 per million of births in 1847 to 18,225 in 1886. In the article on Vaccination in the Encyclopedia Britannica, vol. xxiv. p. 27, the writer (after referring to so-called syphilitic epidemics after vaccination) says: '' As regards the above, and other infantine maladies,  vaccination tion may predispose the child to fall into them, in so far as it produces, or ought in theory to produce, a considerable constitutional disturb- ance, and presumably a loss, for a brief period, of the natural power to resist the various noxious influences, by which the age of infancy, especially among the poor, is beset."  The facts concerning the increase of the most dreaded of these transmissible diseases-vaccino-syphilis-have already been referred to, but such allusions are not palatable to the advocates of Jenner's process. The Lancet, of July 17, 1880, calls Mr. T. J. Hibbert, M.P. for Oldham, and late Parliamentary Secretary to the Local Govern-  VoL. 131.-NO0. 2. N       194 The Westminster Review.  ment Board, to account for the indiscretion of admitting the incri- minating disclosures of a previous Return, No. 433, dated 1877, entitled " Vaccination, Mortality." In a letter to one of his Oldham constituents, July 1880, Mr. Hibbert says: "This Return shows an increase of deaths from syphilis of infants under one from 255 in 1847 to 1554 in 1875, in my opinion one of the most unsatisfactory features in connection with vaccination, and one which leads me to support the proposed modification of the vaccination law now before the House of Commons." This modification referred to a Bill introduced by the Government for the repeal of cumulative penalties, which was defeated through the active opposition of the medical profession under the leadership of Mr. Ernest Hart. There is a noticeable and startling revelation in the Return 392, 1880, which has been persistently and systematically ignored by the defenders of vaccination in Parliament and by the medical profession.  The first year registered, 1847, records the deaths of infants from syphilis under one year per million of births at 472, and there is a somewhat regular progressive ratio up to 1853 as follows :-  1848 . . 515 1850 . . 516 1852. . 612 1849 . . 579 1851 . . 593 1853. . 663  In this year, 1853, the vaccination law came into operation with a large increase in the number of vaccinations, and in 1854 we find the deaths from syphilis jump from 663 to 910 per million of births! The Lancet, of May 9, 1871, reports that Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson, F.R.C.S., brought under the notice of the Medical and Chirurgical Society particulars of thirteen cases in which he believed this disease has been communicated by vaccination after a careful investigation which he had undertaken at the request of Dr. Seaton. In the discussion which followed, Mr. Surgeon Startin said that in thirty years he had seen about thirty cases of syphilis communicated by vaccination. Mr. Startin had taken the trouble to supply the addresses of several of the cases to Mr. Simon, but no notice was taken of them. They were undoubtedly cases where the children had been perfectly healthy, as well as their parents and nurses. Dr. Drysdale also testified that he had vaccinated a child suffering from syphilis, which, in spite of his warning, was afterwards used at one of the large hospitals for the purpose of vaccinating others. The Medical Times, of February 21, 1885, observes that parents ' not unfrequently submit their infants to the operation with reluctance and apprehension. Such scruples merit careful consideration, for not only has the transmissibility of syphilis been proved by disas- trous consequences, but where vaccination has been improperly per- formed, whether through ignorance or negligence, every description of blood-poisoning has been produced," The assumption here is that if reasonable care had been exercised these untoward conse- quences need not have happened. Referring, however, to the    What is the Truth about Vaccination? 195  German Vaccination Commission of 1884, the Medical Times, September 26, 1885, writes :-  " As regards syphilis, one case brought to their notice is most instruc- tive. It is commonly believed that if a child has been so far cured as to present no external evidence of disease, and the vesicles run a perfectly normal course, no harm can result from employing it as a vaccinifer. But at Lebus, in 1876, fifteen female scholars were syphilized by vaccination from a child whose skin was perfectly clear and in whom the vesicles on the eighth day presented a normal appearance."  Well might an eminent advocate of vaccination, Sir Thomas Watson, in the Nineteenth Century, express his sympathy with prosecuted parents for refusing to submit their children to a risk thus ghastly. This distressing increase of infantile syphilis is attributed by Dr. Hubert Boéns, of Charleroi (who has devoted thirty years to the study of epidemic diseases), to vaccination. cowpox he describes as a purulent infection which bears a closer analogy to syphilis than to any other artificially transmissible malady. Dr. Charles Creighton, late Demonstrator in Anatomy, Cambridge University, maintains in his recent monogram, Zhe Natural History of Cowpox and Syphilis, that '' the vaccinal ulcer of everyday practice is, to all intents and purposes, a chancre," and possesses 'the natural history character- istics of cowpox itself," and its universal diffusion accounts for the disproportionate increase of syphilis in children and adults.  That other diseases are excited or communicated by vaccination is shown on the evidence of 242 medical witnesses, who testify as follows:-  Witnesses, Witnesses.

James Stansfeld, when President of the Local Government Board, on the 19th of April 1886, who promised to bring it before his colleagues. It may also be stated that the attention of the Local Government Board, the various medical associations, both at home and abroad, as well as ambassadors, consuls, secretaries to legations, upwards of 4000 men, and all the medical journals, were specially called to the inquiry, and they were requested to contribute facts and information from all parts of the world. This census was instituted by a Committee of Medical Vaccination Experts, with the view of tranquilising the public mind and restoring public confidence in the safety of the operation. The chairman, Dr. Charles Drysdale, told the Committee at one of the preliminary meetings, that it would prove of great value both to the medical profession and to the public, and promised to read a paper concerning its results. These results, so momentous to the public, have not yet been disclosed in any of the leading medical journals.  It is said that if vaccination does not prevent smallpox, it certainly mitigates the severity of the attack and prevents death from the disease. In order to arrive at a correct conclusion on these points, the sources of the alleged facts upon which this new theory is sought to be established should be unprejudiced. Mr. Herbert Spencer lays it down as an absolute rule that all witnesses who profit by a system which they defend are biassed in their judgments, and untrustworthy. The Jennerian protective has been practised for about ninety years, and at the present time produces a revenue of £120,000 a year for public vaccination, and much more for private vaccination, yielding together not less than a quarter of a million yearly, without reckoning the profit derived from the sequele, produced by various forms of contamination, The statements of vaccinators should therefore, for this as well as for other reasons, be accepted with reserve.  On the 19th of June, 1883, Sir Lyon Playfair said, in the House of Commons, '' that an analysis of 10,000 cases in the hospitals of London shows that 45 per cent. of the unvaccinated patients die, and only 15 per cent. of the vaccinated." In other words, a vac- cinated person at Sheffield or Preston is three times as safe as an unvaccinated one at Dewsbury, Keighley, or Leicester. The late Dr. W. B. Carpenter, Dr. George Buchanan, Dr. Sinclair White, the Lancet, and the British Medical Journal have used this argument in an exaggerated form; some of these authorities going the length of maintaining that the deaths by smallpox amongst the unvaccin- ated as compared with the vaccinated were two hundred to one.!  The mere statement of the case, coupled with the well-known  + Report of Medical Officer to Local Government Board, 1883-4.    What is the Truth about Vaccination? 197  experience at Keighley, Leicester, and Sheffield, shows that the vaccinists, in their desire to defend a system closely bound up with their professional interests and prestige, have been led into serious error, 'The figures are partly untrue in fact, and the inferences falla- cious for the following reasons :-  Ist. The unvaccinated, to use the words of Dr. Garth Wilkinson, are differentiated by quality as well as quantity, and comprise the waifs and strays, tramps and criminal classes of society (what Mr. John Bright once called the residuum). These are badly housed, badly fed, often intemperate, and peculiarly subject to overcrowding.  The British Medical Journal, for October 23, 1881, says: "It is probable that a larger proportion of unvaccinated persons is to be found among the ignorant, dirty, and wretched inhabitants of the slums of London, and very few among the educated and better fed members of society. The disease (smallpox) is much influenced by overcrowding." In his evidence before the Select Parliamentary Committee of 1871, Dr. R. H. Bakewell said: ''It must not be forgotten that in all European countries the unvaccinated are taken from the poorest and most neglected classes of the community, and may fairly be expected to be bad subjects for any disease like variola,"  2nd. Infants dying under three months of age, amongst whom epidemic diseases are generally fatal.  3rd. Infants who are pronounced by public vaccinators to be " unfit" for vaccination by reason of their diseased condition or low state of vitality. Such children are always the first to succumb to attacks of smallpox.'  Ath. Whenever and wherever the smallpox hospital returns have been investigated (and numerous instances might be quoted), the results have shown that many patients returned as unvaccinated were found recorded by the official register as "successfully vaccin- ated." The demand has been repeatedly made for the addresses of the fatal cases for the purpose of a similar inquisition at Sheffield, but all applications have been ignored by both the sanitary and municipal authorities.  There is every reason to believe that the hospital test of  vaccination tion is much more rigorous than the ordinary test. Dr. Gayton, of the North Western Hospital, observes (Value of Vaccination, p. 9): " We have, I maintain, no right to accept a mere assertion of vaccination as conclusive. The performance of the operation irrespective of results is one thing; the typical character of the cicatrix is, however, the only trustworthy proof." In June 1885 the authorities of the West Ham Union circulated a report, the accuracy of which was vouched for by Dr. Kennedy, "not as cooked statistics, but unvarnished facts," to the effect that in the smallpox  1 Dr. Vernon, of Southport, in his excellent lecture, Why Little Children Die, says that he has never known an infant under one recover from smallpox.    198 The Westminster Review.  hospital 76 unvaccinated persons had died of smallpox during the six months ending May 14, 1885. Through the intervention of Mr. C. H. Hopwood, then M.P., the addresses of the 76 patients were obtained, and a careful investigation made, the results of which are now before me. Owing to deaths and removals, the facts could not be obtained in 33 cases, but in 43 it was found that 18 had been vaccinated and 3 revaccinated. Of these 5 died of hemorrhagic and 16 of confluent smallpox. Of the 22 found unvaccinated, 4 died of hemorrhagic, 16 of confluent, and 2 of discrete smallpox.  5th. Confluent smallpox often obliterates the vaccine marks, and such cases, when terminating fatally, are generally returned as un- vaccinated by the medical attendant. Dr. Russell, in his Glasgow Report, 1870-1, p. 25, says: '"' Sometimes persons were said to be vaccinated, but no marks could be seen, very frequently because of the abundance of the eruption. In some cases of those which re- covered an inspection before dismissal discovered vaccine marks, sometimes very good."  6th. We are in possession of perfectly reliable evidence concern- ing the mortality from smallpox prior to the discovery of Jenner when all were unvaccinated. Dr. Seaton, in his Handbook of Vaccination, observes: " Dr, Jurin, writing in the last century, laid it down as the result of his investigation, that of persons of all ages taken ill of natural smallpox, there will die one in five or six." The case was forcibly presented by Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace in the Pall Mall Gazette, of March 24, 1885. This distinguished scientific observer says :-  "Of 10,000 cases of smallpox, let 3000 be infants, and 7000 adults. Of the infants let 2000 be unvaccinated, and of the adults let only 500 be unvaccinated. Let the mortality of the infants be 60 per cent., and of the adults about 3 per cent. in vaccinated and unvaccinated alike. The result will be as follows :-  VACCINATED.  1000 infants . . . 600 deaths (60 per cent.) 6500 adults SQ a Ee ee  7500 795 ,, (108 4 )  UNVACCINATED. 2000 infants . : . 1200 deaths (60 per cent.) 500 adults . , SE ug: 4S aw  __  2500 a |  " Thus we see that, even if the mortality of infants and adults is exactly the same in the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, yet, by lumping the two together, an enormously greater mortality is shown for the unvaccin- ated, merely because the unvaccinated predominate among infants, whose mortality is always greatest, and the vaccinated predominate among adults, whose mortality (from smallpox) is always less. The whole thing is a mere arithmetical puzzle, utterly valueless and delusive, yet it has been    What is the Truth about Vaccination ? 199  again and again adduced as conclusive evidence of the value of vaccination, and probably has had more weight with the public and the Legislature than any other argument whatever."  Although this last relic of Jenner's original claim is now accepted by many vaccinal authorities as the utmost limit of the protective virtue of vaccination, this view is not generally adopted. The Lancet, fortified by the opinions of a majority of the medical profes- sion, who have imbibed the vaccine creed from their chiefs as a cardinal dogma of the medical church, is in no way disheartened by the frequency and fatal character of smallpox epidemics, and perti- naciously adheres to the full-blown Jennerian dogma of perfect safety for all the faithful. When Lord Robert Montagu introduced his motion for a Select Committee of Inquiry in the House of Com- mons, he said that " vaccination prevented smallpox in every case," and the Lancet has recently accepted the same view. An Irishman on being examined in court on a horse case swore the animal was fifteen feet high; but later, in the examination, he said fifteen hands. '' Why," said the counsel, "a short time ago you swore he was fifteen feet high." 'Did I," Pat replied, "then bedad I'll stick to it; the horse was fifteen feet high."  When one stone of the vaccine edifice is loosened after the other, the vaccination law repealed and the entire structure crumbling to pieces, there will doubtless be thousands ready to swear to the solidity, utility, and permanence of the Jennerian edifice. When the Bill of 1867 was under discussion in Parliament, both Liberal and Conservative statesmen protested that the people would kick against a law carried by the suppression of incriminating facts showing the failure and evils of. the practice, and Sir Thomas Chambers predicted ''that an agitation would be set on foot which would not cease until the law was repealed." 'This prediction is in the course of literal fulfilment, and every year witnesses the growth of the struggle. There are at the present time about fifty anti- compulsory vaccination leagues in England, several in Scotland, and opponents of the anti-vaccination law in Ireland declare that they are only restrained from joining in the conflict by acute troubles of their own. According to official returns, the number of vaccinations is steadily decreasing, and where the diminution is greatest, infantile mortality, especially, is most perceptibly diminishing. At Eastbourne local magistrates refuse to sit on vaccination cases, and prosecutions have been suspended since 1884; and in Keighley, Leicester, Bingley, Gloucester, Oldham, Falmouth, Halifax, Dewsbury, and the Metropolitan parish of Shoreditch, resolutions have been passed by the boards of guardians against prosecutions for non-vaccination, and the laws have become practically a dead letter. It does not seem probable that Parliament can long retain on the Statute-book laws which are thus limited in their operation and area, and in the     200 The Westminster Review.  face of such large and important exceptions as have been specified. In the debates on the 10th of September 1886, on the 22nd of July 1887, and on the 6th of November 1888, the appointment of a Com- mission of Inquiry was urged upon the Government by Sir U. Kay- Shuttleworth, Mr. Samuel Whitbread, Dr. Gavin Clark, Dr. Charles Cameron, Dr. Farquharson, Dr. R. Macdonald, Mr. J. A. Picton, Mr. Arthur O'Connor, and others; and this proposal is known to have the approval of Mr. James Stansfeld, Sir Charles Russell, Mr. John Morley, Mr. John Bright, Sir Joseph Pease, Sir Lyon Playfair, Sir William Harcourt, Colonel Chaplin, Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, Mr. Jacob Bright, and others of all political parties. Mr. Ritchie refused this reasonable application, mainly on the ground that a statistical Commission had exhaustively investigated the subject within two years. On this point Mr. Ritchie was misinformed, no such investi- gation having taken place. The last Parliamentary Inquiry was made in 1871 by a Select Committee of the House of Commons composed of fourteen partisans and one opponent of vaccination. As might be expected from its composition, the report of this Commission in favour of vaccination was a foregone conclusion-a conclusion, however, rudely shattered by the brutal evidence of facts. Before the printer's ink of the report was well dry, the invasion of the most devastating smallpox epidemic of the present century occurred, which, after eighteen years of universal vaccination, attacked half a million of people and destroyed over 44,000 lives in England and Wales.  Surely in view of all the foregoing facts and considerations it is not too much to ask that a fairly constituted Parliamentary Commis- sion should, with the least possible delay, be appointed to inquire into the advisability of enforcing vaccination by Act of Parliament.
