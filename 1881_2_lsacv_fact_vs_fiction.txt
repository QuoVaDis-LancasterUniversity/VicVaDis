FACT versus FICTION. A REFUTATION OF THE National Health Society's Tract, " The Prevention of smallpox." ENTITLED, 1.-smallpox is a most loathsome and fatal, and the most contagious of diseases. “If no mischief be done either by physician or nurse, smallpox is the most slight and safe of all diseases.” (Sydenham.) "I look upon Scarlet Fever as the most infectious disease that there is." (Marson's Evidence, 1871, Q. 4213.) 2.-Before the introduction of Vaccination, smallpox killed 40,000 yearly in this country. Before 1837 there were no records of the deaths from smallpox in England. "smallpox attained its maximum after inoculation was introduced ; this disease began to grow less fatal before Vaccination was discovered ; indicating together with the diminution in fever, the general improvement in health then taking place. Fever has declined in nearly the same ratio as smallpox ." (DR. FARR, M'Culloch's Statistics of British Empire.) 3.-Thorough Vaccination in infancy is an almost complete protection against smallpox. "Of the 950 cases of smallpox, 870, or 91.5 per cent of the whole cases had been vaccinated.” (Marson's Report of High gate Hospital for 1871.) "There were 43 cases treated in the Bromley Hospital, between April 25th and June 29th. Of confluent smallpox, there were 16 cases; of discrete, 14; of modified, 13. All the cases had been vaccinated-3 revaccinated." (F. NICOLSON, L.R.C.P. Lancet, Aug. 27th, 1881.) 4.-of unvaccinated people one out of every three attacked by smallpox die. “Of 17,151 cases of smallpox (all unvaccinated) 2,848 died, or one in six." (Furin.) 5.-Of perfectly vaccinated people only one dies of every two hundred attacked by smallpox. 6.- Perfect Vaccination is shown by the possession of four well-marked vaccine scars. "Of 75 cases in perfectly vaccinated persons, with four good marks, three died, one of malignant smallpox, or four in one hundred." (Report of Deptford Hospital, 1880.) 7. – Vaccination is harmless and practically painless. "In addition to the fact that people are ill after Vaccination, it is important to remember that people die after the operation, if not from the disease itself, at least from its sequelae, notably erysipelas.” (British Medical Journal, 1877.) "It sometimes endangers life, and in other cases leaves permanent impairment of health.” (Dr. Felix von Niemeyer.) "There can be no doubt that the danger of transmitting syphilis (by Vaccination), is a real and very important one." (JONATHAN HUTCHINSON, F.R.C.S. Illustrations of Clinical Surgery.) The mortality from Infantile Syphilis has increased fourfold, Scrofula has trebled, while skin diseases, Pyamia and mesenteric disease have increased coincidently with increased Vaccination. (Parl. Return, No. 392, Sess. 2, 1880.) 8. – To ensure protection throughout life you should be revaccinated after the age of fifteen. “With reference to revaccination I have no faith in it. Not one of the 36 attendants at the South Dublin Union sheds has taken smallpox. Only seven of the number were revaccinated, and as the remaining 29 enjoyed the same immunity, wherein is the necessity of the operation ?" (F. T. PORTER, M.R.C.S. Medical Press and Circular, March 27th, 1872.) "Even revaccination is not absolutely preventive of smallpox .” (British Medical Journal, 1877.) "Cases of smallpox do occasionally occur after apparently successful revaccination.” (Deptford Hospital Report, 1880.) 9.—Every soldier and sailor is revaccinated; the result is that smallpox is almost unknown in the army and navy, even amid sur rounding epidemics. From 1859 to 1876, there were 1,306 cases of smallpox in the army with 94 deaths, and 686 cases in the navy with 42 deaths. (Vide Appendix to "The Truth about Vaccination." 10.-You can be Vaccinated free of charge by the Public Vaccinator. The Public Vaccinators of England and Wales are paid out of the poor rates nearly £100,000 per annum, and a large amount from general taxation. (Vide Blue Books.) How Vaccination has "Stamped Out" smallpox. ENGLAND & WALES. Vaccination was made compulsory by Act of Parliament in the year 1853; again in 1867, and still more stringent in 1871. Since 1853, we have had three Epidemics of smallpox, each being more severe than the one preceding. Date.

SCLATER-BOOTH, M.P. February 1877. By C. T. PEARCE, M.R.C.S. LONDON Latest Official Evidence of the Results of Vaccination. The Registrar-General in his Annual Summary for the year 1880, tabulates the smallpox Mortality of London for the last thirty years as follows: Decades. Estimated Mean Population. smallpox Deaths It is absurd to say, in the face of these returns, that Vaccination has saved thousands of lives, or that the mortality would have been greater but for vaccination, or that the deaths accrue, as DR. W. B. CARPENTER maintains, from the "un-vaccinated residuum," seeing that in the first decade, when but few, comparatively, were vaccinated, the mortality was not half as great as in the last, when 85 per cent of the infant population had received the benefit of the State-endowed prophylactic. These facts, coupled with the additional one that during the 26 weeks ending July 2nd, 1,635 persons died in London of smallpox, 422 of whom were under 5 years age, show an enormous increase of smallpox, are utterly subversive of the claims of Vaccination, and call loudly for a repeal of the despotic law by which it is enforced.
