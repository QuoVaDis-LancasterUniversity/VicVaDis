S. MILL.  l ON the 19th of June, 1883, the House of Commons passed the  l following resolution :—  “ That, in the opinion of this House, the practice of vaccination  has greatly lessened the mortality from smallpox; and that the  laws relating to it, with such modifications as experience may sug-  gest, are necessary /07 f/e prevention and mitigation of this fatal  and mutilative disease.”  The Select Committee of the House of Commons, 23rd May,  1871, reported, among other matters, that “ smallpox, zzc/ecked by  TSAS AEEA  vaccination, is one of the most terrible and destructive of dis-  eases,” etc., and that, “if vaccination had not been general, this  | epidemic [1871] might have become a pestilence as destructive as  smallpox has often been, wherè the population has been unpro-  | tected.”  | The force of these words is complete, if they are true. The following pages are produced to show that they are inaccurate,  and therefore lacking in the support which can alone give them  |  force.) Dr. Guy, in his paper, asks the question, “ Is vaccination  | a preventive of smallpox?” and answers, “ Z% Z/s question there  is, there can be, no answer, excepi such as is couched in the language of  figures.” This I firmly believe ; and I shall endeavour to find out  what were and what are the special features of smallpox, as a  1 I am dealing with England and London. I haveno present concern with  Iceland, or Mexico, or Peru, or even Europe, besides England. They would  require separate treatment, the conditions being very various.

In doing this I have been indebted to the following authorities :  —Dr. Farr’s article, “ Epidemics,” in M‘Culloch’s “ Statistical  Account of the British Empire ;”1 Sydenham’s Works? ; Duvil-  lard’s “ Analyse et Tableaux, de l’Influence de la petite vérole,”  etc. ;* the Blue Books of 1857 and of 1871, and many Smallpox  Hospital Reports, including the account of the London Smallpox  and Inoculation Hospital, 1746 to 1763, from the opening to the  last-named year, etc., etc. ; and last, but not least, to Dr. Guy,  F.R.C.P., F.R.S, etc., whom I have largely drawn upon.” The  paper of Dr. Guy covers a large number of authorities, and I  would refer to it for them.  This period of two hundred and fifty years of London life  3 E a  covers a history chequered by many and various vicissitudes, and  social and political revolutions ; and, on the whole, covers changes  TEST Eaa Smee EEEE  producing immense improvement in the life of the people. “The  diseases of London in the 16th century still prevail in unhealthy  climates—not only the diseases, but the manner of death have  changed in this metropolis ; but the frequency and fatality of the  principal diseases have diminished.” 6  “ The reported cases of fever, plague, cholera, and dysentery  constituted four-tenths of the diseases; they destroyed annually  31 per thousand of the inhabitants. . . ... Smallpox attained  its maximum mortality after inoculation was introduced.” "  It is not easy to trace smallpox prior to Sydenham’s time. So  uncertain is its history (I speak of England), that Dr. Farr cau-  tiously says—“ It is not unlikely that smallpox formed more than  one of the epidemics” ° of England at the time of the Conquest ;  but we cannot tell certainly. I prefer, therefore, following Dr.  Guy’s line, and beginning with 1629.  Smallpox is, and has always been, an epidemic disease. There  1 2nd Edition, London, 1839.  ? By R. G.

The exact causes of this epidemic tendency are not  known, but the fact remains. These epidemic displays of small  pox “have been of most frequent occurrence” in the 18th century,  and in the latter half of it. _  The smallpox of two hundred years ago was, as regards the dis-  ease itself, the very same as to-day.”  The disease is, broadly speaking, of two kinds: discrete or dis-  tinct, and confluent. The eruption is the key to the disorder.  These are subdivided into other classes, but broadly cover all.  The confluent are now generally divided into the confluent and  malignant. The discrete smallpox is of a very simple character,  requires no treatment but nursing, and nearly all recover. The  confluent is intractable, and the malignant form very fatal and  hideous. What varies the exhibition? The condition of those  attacked. The soil and the surroundings. Sydenham was care-  ful, on the appearance of pustules, to “ consider carefully whether  they belong to the distinct or confluent species.” * “I consider  that the confluent smallpox is as different a disease from the dis-  nowise dangerous,” and “very rarely leaves its mark” upon the  face.  In all these points we recognise the smallpox of today The  distinct, as Dr. Wagstaffe said, “a nurse cannot kill,” the bad  confluent cases “a physician can never cure.” °  The disease remains just as Sydenham and Massey and Wag-  staffe, etc., described it. But the incidence of smallpox has  changed. Variola used to be a disease of childhood almost en  tirely. It now affects childhood less, and young man and young  womanhood more. Dr. Lambert gives (1763) 72 cases of variola,  70 were under ten years of age.° At Berlin, 1757 to 1774, of  3493 smallpox deaths, 3464 were 15 years and under; only 29  above 15. These were males. Of 3212 females, 3196 were 15  years and under, 16 only over 15 years. And the Geneva figures  of Duvillard, Mr. Simon gives as under: —  1 Dr. Guy, p. 404. ?

In the Metropolitan Hospital report 1870-1-2, 0f 11,174 “ vac-  cinated” cases, 5,689 were over 20 years of age.? Other hospitals  are similar. Excepting in this particular, smallpox during the  250 years is unchanged.  But the Committee of 1871 tell us it was the most terrible of  diseases, and the resolution of 1883 implies almost the same thing.  There is a good deal of current opinion in this direction, but, as  will have been noted already, it is not supported by facts. I have  quoted Dr. Farr for the statement that 4-10ths of the diseases of  250 years ago were fever, plague, cholera, and dysentery. small  pox has never in this period been the most destructive or terrible  English disease. At its height,‘ when artificially cultivated, it  was far overstepped by fever. It is so still. Consumption was  more than twice as mortal. But itis very curious that if we take  analogous periods we shall find much more than this to be true.  For those years when smallpox was most prevalent, and now  when it is most prevalent, were not, and are not, the years of  greatest mortality. The years of greatest mortality are those of  the least extension of smallpox. ‘The exhibition of this fact has  stupidly led some to charge us with fondness for smallpox. We  are merely pointing to national experience, and cannot alter it to  suit a theory. This experience is conclusive. Smallpox is not,  and has not been our worst disease foe.

That is, the years of heaviest smallpox pro-  duced no more deaths than the years of lightest smallpox. These  figures again prove that smallpox “unchecked by vaccination,”  as it was in these centuries, was 720ć the “most destructive and  terrible of diseases.” They show that smallpox was never so ter-  rible as some other diseases, and never so much to be dreaded.  Rests, the question, is the behaviour of smallpox the same in  the present century and since vaccination? In short, is smallpox  an uncontrolled disorder? Does it continue its epidemic preva-  lence, and when epidemic, does it increase the mortality or no ?  The opinion of the House of Commons in June last was, that  smallpox was not among us as aforetime, but by the influence of  vaccination was varied in extent and mortality. Before giving the  figures for this century, I wish to give a caution against laying too  much stress upon the greatness of the mortalities of /72-74g7stration  times. The population even of London was unknown. It is  assumed that, for the periods so far treated in this paper, the  population of London was either stationary or declining, or if not,  was only kept from declining by immigration from the country.  While not sharing in this belief, it is well to point out that, in  whatever line lies the truth, there can be no question that the  deaths were better known than the births. Even in our own day  influences exist against the complete correctness of the birth regis-  1 M ‘Culloch, vol. ii. p. 579. [The years were selected by Dr. Farr, not by  me.]  ? Dr. Guy and others, in apparent oversight of the impropriety of the course,  exclude the worst diseases from comparison. Why, I can only conjecture.

Butin the period under revision, the births, excepting such  as were followed by church christenings, were not known.) ‘Thus,  having no census, the population was unknown, and therefore the  one element most necessary for comparison with our time is want-  ing. `I shall, therefore, try to avoid the error of comparing periods of  differing conditions.

The differ-  ence in smallpox is ten times! But using so large a number of  recent years is misleading. We are making the mistake of com-  paring periods when the conditions of living were not alike. Few  words need be added to the following eloquent figures to prove  this statement.  They are eminently applicable to London, for the Act of 1866  prohibited, after the passing of the Act, among other things, that  any one should “ open into the Thames any sewer, drain, pipe, or  channel, with intent, or in order thereby, to provide for the flow  or passage of sewage, or of any other offensive or injurious matter,”  etc., etc.) It must not be forgotten, also, that the Sanitary Act of  1866 has done a good deal to teach carefulness, and thus pre-  vent the spread of disease.  The total amount of the loans which were sanc-  tioned by the General Board of Health,  under the Public Health Act of 1848, to  to the 1st of September, 1858, was £2,956,178  The sanctions granted under the Act of 1858,  and the Sewage Utilisation Act of 1865,  ørior to 7877 (19th August), was -67,303,366  But since the constitution of the Local Govern-  ment Board, the amounts sanctioned to  be raised by the urban and rural sanitary  authorities 182... e i 426,768,545  It is clear, therefore, that we must divide these years if we are  to deal with periods of equal conditions. This I have done in  the following tables :—  tables and the following ones. I have not the complete returns for each year  and have used the “ Annual Summary, 1882.”  1 Thames Navigation Act, 1866.  3 Eleventh Annual Report of the Local Government Board, 1882, p. lxvi.

We have gained the cor-  rect reading of our metropolitan experience of smallpox. During  the period when smallpox was “unchecked” by vaccination, and  during the period of its enforcement, the behaviour of smallpox is  alike. There are years of epidemics, and years of lull. The  epidemic years show a less annual loss of life than the other  years. Variola follows its old course. It is still “unchecked.”  The Registrar-General’s 1881 summary gives me a hint to draw  attention to one other point before proceeding to the other part of  my inquiry.)  As we have seen in the last table of “most smallpox,” 1881 was  the third heaviest year for smallpox in the last twenty.years. On  this the Registrar-General remarks—“ Only on seven occasions  had this rate been exceeded in the previous 43 years; and the  prevalence of this disease was the more remarkable, inasmuch as  neither the rest of England and Wales, nor any one of the other  large towns was similarly affected ; moreover, the same unhappy  pre-eminence in regard of smallpox had been displayed by the  metropolis for several years.”  I am therefore justified in believing that the preceding pages of  Dr. Guy’s tables are not an accurate picture of cozxzizy smallpox  for England of 1629 to 1881 ; and that their inaccuracy lies in  giving an exaggerated idea of the amount of smallpox affecting  the country, by presuming that it was equal to London. The  strong probability is, that it was not either so often epidemic, or  so long prevalent, in the country? as in London. The report of  the Newcastle Dispensary,® 1777 to 1878—one hundred years—  confirms me in this belief. The admissions of smallpox patients  were :—  1 Annual Summary, London, 1881, p. 6.  ? Dr. Wm. Douglas, quoted by Wagstaffe, says of the inoculators from the  towns that “ they do all they can to persuade the country towns to come into  it, though they generally have escaped in former smallpox times.”—A//endix,  p. 8.  3 Report of the Newcastle Dispensary from its Foundation, 1777 to 1878.—  Page 24 gives the following :—‘ The mortality of smallpox reached its highest  point, 33 per cent. in the five years 1802-7. . . .. I am of opinion that they  leave us in this dilemma, either that there now exists a grossly exaggerated im-  pression of the prevalence and fatality of smallpox in former times, or else that  they had begun to decrease long before the discovery of vaccination, the bene-  ficial effects of which must at least have been assisted by other causes.” This content downloaded from 148.88.247.59 on Tue, 24 May 2022 18:18:53 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 1777 to 1802 365 patients received.   1802. „U 1852... n. 1,198 3 3  E852 n S77 O59 3 3  The twenty towns given by the Registrar-General annually for  comparison, cover the following, which are as widely different in  respect of vaccination as any.

The opinion of  the Select Committee of the House of Commons is mere opinion  still. Itis worse, itis opinion not supported and buttressed, but  destroyed by facts. Smallpox is not the most terrible of diseases.  It is unchecked. I leave to the second part the inquiry as to  whether we can show that the faults of its presence, mortality and  H  fatality, and extension, are due to an unvaccinated population  living among the others, whose suffering is now recorded in our  national experience, and so induces us to misread the facts.  Having endeavoured to show that smallpox pursues its natural  course now just as formerly, that it is the same disease and acts  in the same manner as of yore, I now proceed to the further  1 For the ten years, 1871 to 1880, the following is the smallpox rate per  100,000 for each of the following towns :—London, 46; Nottingham, 39;  Sunderland, 92; Leeds, 18; Oldham, 13; Brighton, 9; Rradford, 8.

If so, Has it done so   uniquely ?—and, second, if it remains among us, is it only among  those who have not submitted to the Jennerian rite? With this  I also propose to include the inquiry, whether the House of Com-  mons was correct in saying that the mortality was lessened, and  if lessened, whether that lessening is due to vaccination? And  frst, has smallpox decreased, and is the mortality lessened ?  I have incidentally shown that smallpox was more prevalent in  the 18th than in the 17th century. And I have hinted at its being  due to a determined propagation of variola by medical men. This  practice had its rise, its sway and reign, in the 18th century. It  gradually fell into disrepute and was prohibited in 1840.’ Let us  for a few moments inquire to what extent the artificial extension  of it went. The original London Smallpox Hospital was not  founded only to receive smallpox patients. It was founded in  1746, and in 1751, 131 had been inoculated. Up to 1763, 3434  had been inoculated, while 5612 had the smallpox “in the natural  way,” by “infection.” Considerably more than half, therefore,  of the patients were artificially ill. But that states the case  mildly; for those who were brought as patients could infect the  public no more, while many were inoculated and then suffered  to go home, “transmitting far and wide,” as one says, “the  fatal contagion.” Dr. Wm. Douglas, before quoted, says “ inocu-  lation rendered the infection so universal and intense,” that many  would have escaped it if not thus propagated. Dr. Wagstaffe said  inoculation “tends to Ż¢77, to propagate, and continue an infec-  tion in a place.” Another thing tending to further intensify this  tendency was, that if a person went to Coldbath-Fields (the proper  smallpox) Hospital he was to pay a deposit of £1 2s., but the  persons entering for inoculation the Lower Street, Islington, Hos-  pital, went in free.  Curious advertisements tempted people to anticipate having  smallpox. I have copies of such for Leeds, Gloucester, and Edin-  burgh. One of these say that “not less than 10,000 people had  been under the care of the practitioners in this part of the world”  (Gloucester). For the seven years 1721-8, Kirkpatrick gives 897  inoculations, or about 130 a-year. We shall not be far wrong in  asserting that it was at least four times as prevalent a practice as  this, most of the century. For several years up to 1763 the hos-  1 3rd and 4th Victoria, Cap. 29, Section viii.

We shall then, at the  smallest computation, have some 50,000 centres of infection in  the 18th century in London more than the 17th, and all of them  artificially raised. Moore says the practice caused “millions ” of  deaths.) But the only certain conclusion we can draw from the  histories of it is, that they who use 18th century smallpox as if it  were natural, are either very ignorant or culpable. I shall, there-  fore, omit it, as I have before stated it for those who wish to know  what it was. We have then the following :—  LONDON.  Pre-registration Years.

There was  more in 1801-10 than in 1629-35. But since that time it decreased  to 40 per 100,000 without compulsory vaccination acts; and  though the period, 1851 to 1870 showed a lull, we are worse off  in the last decade than in the ten years 1841-50, when it is certain  not more than half of the people were vaccinated. I purpose,  therefore, to make an examination of the last twenty years with a  view to finding an answer to the question, as to whether we are  in a position of making such gains as we have here, from smallpox  uniquely, or in common with gains from other diseases? I give  these figures for England and Wales, the London Summary fails  me for several of the classes. The story would be only accen-  tuated by substituting London, so far as I can see. The heaviest  smallpox year since registration is 1871, and some other recent  years stand very high.  1 “History of Smallpox,” London, 1815, p. 233.

In high and in low years, the diseases due to our vari-  able climate alter the totals but little ; in the others, there is great  ` variation. Almost all the years of the greatest mortality are those  of the highest figures for scarlet fever, typhus, and diarrhœa. The  great fall in these diseases in the years of least mortality, enables  us to assert that the fall is due to improved conditions, and to the  great [the Public Health Acts] expenditure before noted. This  saving of life is the return for the outlay of the millions of pounds  thus employed. Itis not in smallpox that the startling decrease  results ; and I do not hesitate to say that the absurd trust reposed  in the Jennerian rite is to some extent responsible for this—a trust  leading to recklessness and foolish exposure, if really held.) Till  the rite is in abeyance we cannot tell certainly if we cannot con-  trol smallpox by sanitation equally with other diseases. But that  is supposition. The fact is, that we have not yet obtained that  equal control over it. Smallpox has not declined uniquely; for  every life saved from smallpox, we here show five saved from  scarlet fever, nearly four from typhus, nearly three from phthisis,  and more than two from diarrhœa and dysentery.  So far as the London “ Annual Summary ” will carry us, it con-  firms this view, and I give it below. The fall year by year in some  of the diseases for the last ten years is most noteworthy, but I  have not space to exhibit it.  | | RSCR DOX.

I fear the entire modern theory of re-vaccination  arose, not from any examination of the case, statistically or other-  wise, but from the exigencies of failure.  Another point arises. The vaccinated are the great bulk of  the victims of smallpox. What sort of vaccination did they show?  A difficulty attends us even here, for, as the Fulham Hospital re-  porter (1878) shows, doctors have no uniform standard. Each has  his idea of what vaccination was “ good,” or “ bad,” or “ imperfect,”  or “fair,” or “ moderate,” or even “indifferent.” Consequently,  every one of these terms forms a heading, under which, with infi-  nite pains, these thousands of patients have been classed. But  the reports differ materially in the use of them.” I have been at  some further pains with these designations—have collected them  in one large and bewildering table. Forty-six thousand of them.  And the following are some of the forms in which they may teach  us valuable lessons.  Of 46,153 cases of smallpox, only 8,084 were definitely classed  as “unvaccinated.” From less than a third up to two-thirds of  these died. So that we know that many of them were in full  eruption, or had the malignant kind.: The plan is to classify by  the appearance of the arm on entry. Many of these cases would  have any pre-existing vaccination marks covered up by eruption.  + I say confessed. And I speak all the paper through of England. Iam  glad that we have not to bear the shame or responsibility for the statement of  Dr. Warlomont, that we have been looking all this century in vain for a single  case of serious smallpox closely following successful vaccination (“ Traité,”  Paris, 1883, p. xvi.).'  ? Some reports do not couple the marks with the state of the eruption, many  omit all notice of the eruption, others do not use “marks” but qualify by the  terms as applied to vaccination. Thus “good vaccination” or ‘imperfect  vaccination,” etc. Others, again, give the classification by eruption for only a  portion of their experience. Some give “ doubtful” for one column; but again  many have no “doubts” exposed to view. Mr. Marson’s “unvaccinated”  were classed as “ unprotected,” which is not the same thing.  3 Of 254 unvaccinated persons in Glasgow Hospital, only 13 per cent. had  the eruption “ rare;” in 87 per cent. it was “copious” or “confluent.” And  Dr. Russell observes on the classification, ‘Even the best vaccine mark is  readily obscured, or even hidden, by a copious eruption.” He remarks no  “allusion to this difficulty ” in the London and Dublin reports.

There were 7,295 whose marks were not  classed, or the goodness or badness noted in such a way as to use  it here. The remaining cases are as follows :—  Vaccinated, but no vaccination marks, 1,669  Do. with traces of vaccination marks, : 163  Do. with one, or with “one or more,” “mo-  derate,” or “imperfect,” or indifferent  vaccination marks, s 3: 7537  Do. with two do., do., do., do., £. 1,852  Do. with three do., do., do., do., S I,I45  Do. with four do., do., do., do., s 587  Do. with one, or one or more, “fair” or “good”  . vaccination marks, =... s 5,713  Dò. with two, do., do., do., do., 54,013  Do. with three, do., do., do., do., 1.: 2,IO1  Do. four, or four and more, do., do., do., do., 1,722  Strangely enough, Mr. Ernest Hart can find comfort even in  such a tabulation. If “good” or “fair” vaccination is better than  “bad,” or “imperfect,” then we ought to find the “good” and  “ fair” vaccination marks cases noticeable by their absence.

I cannot suppose so ill of them.  Vaccination is, however, in no difficulty for lines of defence. I  have noted the change in the incidence of smallpox in our recent  experience. Is not this a proof that childhood is protected? So  ran the fancy, and the doctrine did not tarry. But here again I  am entrenched behind this hospital clinical experience. The plea  is vain. The hospital now at Highgate, in its earlier history, had  (1838) only 13⁄4 per cent. of its vaccinated cases under ten years  of age. ‘The recent years I cannot obtain from this hospital ; but  Stockwell, 1879, had 16 per cent. of its vaccinated cases under  ten years; Homerton, 1880, had 14 per cent. This does not  confirm the theory of protection. The vaccination of the young  lives is extended by compulsion, and they show it by appearing in  smallpox hospitals in ever-increasing abundance.

A more curious  example of the fallacy of the classification by vaccination marks  than the following, I have not met.  If there is any virtue in “good vaccination,” then we should  find fewer in proportion of this kind, in smallpox patients, than of  the “indifferent” or “bad.” ‘Taking the vaccinated without any  distinction of good or bad, there were out of a hundred cases—  VACCINATED WITHOUT DISTINCTION—  All under 30 years of age—  Fulham, 1880, ..…. e ce a 71 per cent.

In short, the wearing out theory is, as poor Jenner said, “ destroyed by facts.”  I think I need not labour this point, but proceed to the inquiry if we can find trace of vaccination “ zZigažing” the disease in those whom we have seen that it fails to protect.  Before I place this case statistically before my readers, I wish to point out an initial and serious difficulty which arises 707 f/e nature of the disorder. If I was followed when dealing in the first part with the nature of the disease, it will need little more to enforce this. Smallpox is, of all fevers, the one most seriously affecting the skin. There is no guide like the state of the skin to the severity of the disease. It follows that a classification of a severe eruptive fever, if it is to be by vaccination marks, should be made before the patient is iil. But this cannot be done. The classification is made when the body is often in full eruption.  Thus we must necessarily class the mild cases more accurately than the severe.*  1 One could say accurately that the mild cases must show few errors, and the bad cases many. Glasgow Report, p. 32, says :—  ““ Of 330 persons having ‘good marks,”  74 per cent. had “rare” eruptions,  22 do. copious do.  and only 4 do. confluent do.  Of 566 vaccinated persons,  59 per cent. had “rare” eruptions,  29 do. copious do.  I2 do. confluent do.”  To say that the case is bad on admission, is to describe the liability to error in the classification.  a This content downloaded from 148.88.247.59 on Tue, 24 May 2022 18:18:53 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms The following table illustrates this :—  LONDON SMALLPOX HOSPITAL, 1836 TO 1867.

Because  they were the worst cases; and hence the “doubt.” Every doubt  solved must increase the fatality of the vaccinated class; and in  many reports there are no doubts—all not quite clear were classed  “ unvaccinated.”  The scientific classification is by the eruption. Let us take this  as given in the following hospitals—first Dr. Gregory’s, 1838, be-  fore vaccination was general, and those giving this classification,  viz.—Fulham, 1877 to 1881 ; Hampstead, 1876 to 1878 ; Homer-  ton, 1871 to 1877; and Stockwell, 1879.

I regret thatI cannot give the experience of pre-vacci-  nation times, similarly divided ; it would help the solution of the  case most materially, but statistical inquiry is not of very great age  in medicine. ‘The description of Sydenham answers perfectly to  the classification and statistics of recent years, but no tabulation  is to be found. Failing that, I give the following, which is per-  fectly reliable. I cannot extendit. IfI include Dr. Farr’s table  1 I have adopted Dr. Gregory’s three classes, and this has necessitated class-  ing all the divided confluent together, and making it embrace the malignant  cases not separated by Dr. Gregory.

The totals coincide wonderfully, but in the first a aze uuvacci- nated, and in the second, most are vaccinated. The presence of vaccination makes no difference, the previous table witnesses the  same thing.  BEFORE VACCINATION.  | Deaths Year. Authority. | Cases. Deaths. per Cent. | of Cases.

And it only remains to see if the classification of few deaths by smallpox among the vaccinated and many among the unvaccinated can be justified.  1 Quoted in full by Duvillard.  ?

The following tables contain the experience of Dr. Gregory’s  Hospital, 1838; Homerton, 1871-7; and Hampstead, 1876-78 :—  Deaths per cent.  Unvaccinated. Cases. Deaths. of Cases.

The disease follows the old lines exactly. The  separation of the confluent class in recent years enables me to  put this stronger still.  MALIGNANT SMALLPOX.  Vaccinated,  Hospitals. Cases.

Deptford, 1878-9, =: -. 8 100.0  These tables prove to me conclusively that the factor influenc-  ing the fatality of the smallpox is the eruption, in both vaccinated  and unvaccinated. And I will venture to suggest that were the  terrors of the vaccine laws out of the way, many more of the mild  unvaccinated cases would go into the hospitals, and the classifica-  tion would be.almost identical.’ Perhaps not quite, for we must  not forget that all the weakly infants are set aside permanently  among the unvaccinated. The vaccinated are a selected set of  lives. The influence of the public vaccinator’s selection must  prejudice the hospital unvaccinated; and it would lead us to  expect a worse result from them under any disease.  I claim to have shown in this paper that the resolution of the  19th June last and the report of the 1871 Select Committee are  equally contradicted by facts :—  a That the smallpox is not checked by vaccination ; that it has  never been the most terrible of diseases.  Ż That smallpox has decreased in prevalence, but that is a fea-  ture common to it and other diseases ; and that other dis-  eases have much exceeded it in severity, and yet also in  decline, in consequence of sanitation.  c That while some of the worst diseases of 200 years ago are  banished, or nearly so, smallpox still exhibits its epidemic  character. - And,  1 The temptation to nurse the mild unvaccinated cases at home must be very  strong, and doubtless is acted on in many cases.  ? The difference between the ideal of vaccination in a public vaccinator and  that of a Local Government Board inspector is well illustrated (p. 16) in Dr.  Bridges’ paper on Smallpox Hospitals, 1876-8, No. 75. Of 1,376 pauper  children examined all vaccinated, only 31 per cent. were, in his opinion, ““ effi-  ciently” vaccinated.

The fatality is, as is  the eruption, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated.  These points established, compel me to conclude that the Vac-  cination Acts are a mistake, and useless from a sanitary point of  view; and may, with all safety to the national well-being, be  speedily repealed.  1 Absurd guesses are made of the smallness of the number of the unvacci-  nated in the population, mostly arrived at by treating all vaccinated children  as living, and most unvaccinated children as dead.

Why,  95 per cent. of the people were reported to be protected by vacci-  nation. His reply was, “ Don’t you believe your own theory?”  (Loud cheers.) What harm can a healthy, unvaccinated babe  possibly do to children believed to be protected? (Hear.) He  could not understand how any one who had the smallest faith in  vaccination could have any fear about the five per cent. of un-  vaccinated children. (Cheers.) These were the facts. He felt  a great difficulty in relying upon statistics. As regarded the cost,  he thought that probably two millions a-year was paid to the  medical profession on account of vaccination (shame); and, so  far as their labour was concerned, they earned the money; but  they earned it throughout the country under circumstances of  enormous disadvantage. Whena medical man called to vaccinate  a child in Belgravia, he said to the anxious mother, “ Wait.”  Why wait? “Wait till I get a good case.” But the parish  doctor vaccinated. by the score with any lymph that might be  available. (Hear, hear, and cries of “Shame.”) Well, these  considerations were overwhelmingly conclusive to his mind, and  there was no answer to them. If vaccination were 4 safe and  harmless and certain thing, no doctor would be more afraid of  harm from vaccination than from baptising. (Hear and laughter.)  A vote was then taken as for and against vaccination, and the  CHAIRMAN decided that a very large majority of those present  were against vaccination.  On the motion of Dr. CoLLıns, seconded by Dr. Wyr» (who  expressed his astonishment to find his friend, the Chairman, such  a pronounced anti-vaccinator), a hearty vote of thanks was  accorded to Sir Thomas Chambers for the courtesy, impartiality,  and ability with which he had presided.  The CHAIRMAN, in acknowledging the vote of thanks, said that  if Dr. Wyld received one-tenth of the painful letters from agonised  parents that he received, he would be excused for having put the  doubtful points strongly. He had not, however, committed him-  self further than that cumulative penalties ought not to be main-  tained upon a medical theory. (Cheers.)
