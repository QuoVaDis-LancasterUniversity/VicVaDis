Speaking of Governments, a celebrated man has truly remarked -  "Diese nur kann ich dafiir erkennen, die jedem erleichtert Gut zu denken, dock nie, dass er so denke bedarf." *  There is a certain cliqne in the present House of Commons about to forge fetters for the people of England that demands immediate attention. Englishmen and Englishwomen are not generally aware that an Act of Parliament has been framed, and this Session will, if possible, be smuggled quietly through the House, to compel every single individual among us to be vaccinated. The folly of this measure is so rampant, that hardly any one believes it possible it can 'be seriously meant. Nevertheless, it is a fact. Eveiy man and every woman, whether riclx or poor, old or young, willing or unwilling, believing or unbelieving, will be compelled to undergo this operation of having the foul matter of a dis- eased being circulated in the healthy blood of his or her veins. It will be in vain for any one to exclaim, " But I would rather not be vaccinated ". The reply will be, " You must". In vain some may protest that they do not believe in the value of vaccination. It will be retorted, " No matter what you believe; do as you are bid". In vain some may feel nervous, and afraid of the results of the infusion of this poison into the healthy blood of their aged parents or tender children, when they recall the not unfrequent cases of death  ; * . . * , • . ? *m . ¦ i •• ¦ ¦ ' - r i , • 1  * "This only am I esteem a good Government, which facilitates every one to think rightly, but compels no one."  A 2   4   resulting from this transference of one man's disease to another. The answer will he, " Silence, you fool ; you must take the consequence of your own supineness and apathy. The Act is passed ; respect the law. There was a time when you read in the newspapers of the preparation of this Act : at that time you were silent and held your tongue. It is now too late; it has become law : you must obey. What, he ! surgeon ! do your duty : heed not his struggles." Yes, old dowagers, you must and will be vaccinated unless you speak out now. Yes, old gentlemen, you must take off your coats and perforce receive this tainted lymph, unless, indeed, you take up the rallying cry of the only man who has at present the firmness to protest, and that is John Gibbs, of St. Leonards.*  Vaccination may be a great and glorious discovery, and calculated to shed the greatest lustre upon its famous origi- nator, Dr. Jenner, and it may be altogether to the purpose for men in authority to strive to extend its supposed beneficent influence ; but it cannot lie denied that, at the same time, there is a large and daily increasing number of educated and talented men, medical as well as lay, who behold in this prac- tice simply a foul blot upon the page of science, a meddle- some interference in the Providential direction of mundane affairs, and a basis of the most fatal diseases. This con- viction, founded, indeed, upon pure scientific deductions from carefully considered premises, is by no means confined to our own country ; but is still more to be found in those where vaccination having been for years enforced every opportunity has been afforded for experimental know- ledge. And especially is this the case in Wirtemberg and Austria, where vaccination is very strictly applied, as well as in France, where the medical world is beginning to burst asunder those fetters of authority which have hitherto restricted the free expansion of ideas. It is right enough for those who admire vaccination to be vaccinated themselves and cause their children to be vaccinated ; but it is a palpable violation of our Constitutional liberties to drive vaccination down the throats of those who reasonably object to it. It has ever been a Briton's boast that he would be free. Free trade, free institutions, free press, freedom of thought and action, have so long prevailed in this country that we cannot but regard freedom as our birthright.  * There are several now who come nobly forward, among wjiom are George Gibbs, of Darlington ; Dr. Michell, M.P. for Bodmin ; Mr. Brotherton, M.P. for Salford; Sir George Strickland, Bart., M.P. for Preston; Mr. Frewen, M.P. for East Sussex; Mr. Barrow, M.P. for Nottinghamshire ; Mr T. S. Duncombe, M.P. for Finsbury ; Mr. Henley, M.P. for Oxfordshire ; Mr. Miall, M.P. for Rochdale ; Drs. Cormack, Fraser, and Semple, and others.   s   Fifty years have elapsed since Edward Jenner employed -vaccination against smallpox, and that Woodville, Pearson, Odier, Decarro, and others rested neither night nor day in propagating their favourite doctrine ; but, before proceeding to compulsory laws, it would be desirable, as Dr. Val. Muller expresses himself, " to prove a causal relation between vac- cination and smallpox."  We find the first traces of smallpox towards the termi- nation of the sixth century, in a part of Arabia ; thence it spread in Asia and Europe. This fearful scourge carried off, according to its violence, every seventh, tenth, or fourteenth person.  Now, we have it laid down as a natural law that plagues or epidemics are subject to be worn out, as all mundane affairs. The lepra went through the degrees of commence- ment, violence, and gradual decrease. The same with the sweating sickness, with the black death, with the plague properly so called, with cholera, and others.  It was in 1775 that Dr. Jenner made his first observations, and about 1810 to 1820 that vaccination became general over Europe, and enforced by despotic kings and emperors. Now, it is important to bear in mind that the great epidemic was in 1796, so that Jennet's ideas were promulgated just exactly at that moment when the scourge was declining. Had any one proposed vaccination, and could have had the experiment tried for cholera in 1837, or in 1848, undoubtedly it would have proved as potent in the intermediate periods as vacci- nation between 1796 and 1838, and more or less since. Various remedies were tried : antimony, mercury, /Ethiop's mineral, pitch water, vesicatories, and the change of the character of the poison by the use of quinine. This last was advocated strenuously by Boerhave, Lobb, Berkley, Greiner, and Medi- cos, all famous men. Among other things, about 1741, a lady introduced inoculation as a remedy, and, according to Pringle's and Lettsom's tables, in London alone 24,549 more children died after the introduction of inoculation in 42 years than in 42 years before ; and yet thousands were ready to swear to the good effects of this same remedy, or prophy- lactic, that now is branded by the Legislature under the name of felony.  The bulk of our present medical authorities have already lost faith in the permanent protection contained in the vaccine matter, and before very long, perhaps, their little remaining faith will be also gone. The best authority that ever existed on vaccination is Dr. Gregory, and he says, page 209 of " Gregory's Lectures on Eruptive Fevers" : -  " In tho years 1818-19, an epidemic smallpox pervaded Scotland, the first that had occurred in theso countries since tho great epidemic  A 3   of 1796. During this epidemic, many vaccinated persona passed through a mild form of smallpox. The general confidence in vacci- nation was in no degree shaken. In 1824 smallpox prevailed epi- demically in Sweden, and attacked a considerable number of vaccinated persons. In 1825 this epidemic visited London ; a great increase of the deaths by smallpox appeared in the bills of mortality, and many persons vaccinated in early life took the disease. In 1826-27, France suffered from an extension of the same epidemic, which fell with great severity upon the population of Marseilles. Many vaccinated persons went through the modified disease. In 1829, the same epidemic invaded the north of Italy, and was particularly severe at Turin. In the same year, the Governments of Germany, who had always en- couraged and even enforced vaccination, seeing the steady advance of the disease towards them, took alarm ; and then began that practice of RE- VACCINATION which has formed so striking a feature in the medical history of the German States for the last twelve years. It commenced in the Royal armies of Wirtemberg. Then succeeded the re-vaccination of the Prussian, Danish, and Baden armies.  " In 1835, the Government of Wirtemberg, satisfied with the results of the military trials, extended the plan, and ordered the re-vaccination of the entire civil population of the kingdom.  " Ceylon was a British colony when the Government earliest in- terfered and most vigorously encouraged tho practice of vaccination. Salaried vaccinators wore scattered over the whole island. So success- ful were their labours, that, up to the beginning of 1819, it had often been said that the experiment of oxterminating smallpox had been made and successfully carried out in Ceylon. In July, 1819, how- ever, a severe epidemic smallpox broke out there. In 1830, a second epidemic overspread the island ; in 1833 a third ; and in 1836 a fourth. In these four epidemics 12,557 persons were attacked, of whom 4090 died, being at the rate of 33 per cent., or one out of every three. In each of these epidemics, a certain number of vaccinated took the smallpox. The proportion of the vaccinated to the un- protected varied : in the third epidemic, out of a total of 460 at- tacked, 341 represented themselves as vaccinated.  " Denmark has undergone several visitations of epidemic smallpox; yet in no country in Europe has more attention been paid to vac- cination both as respects numbers and purity of lymph. The first was in 1824, the second in 1826, the third in 1829. Copenhagen suffered also in the years 1833 and 1835.  "England experienced the second visitation of this century in 1838, and again many vaccinated persons suffered attacks of this malady. This epidemic commenced in the summer of 1837, and did not termi- nate till December, 1839. The total deaths throughout England and Wales during that period (two years and a half) by small -pox amounted to 30,819, or an average of 12,200 deaths per annum. Calculating that the rate of mortality ruled about 20 or 25 per cent., it follows that in these thirty months there occurred in England and Wales not fewer than 154,000 cases of smallpox."  In 1829 the invasion of epidemic smallpox and failure of the vaccination induced the Sardinian Government to try a variety of new l vmphs ; and Dr. Griva, chief of the vaccine establishment at Turin, says not any difference was observed in the new and old. In Wirtemberg, between 1831 and 1836, forty new varieties of lymph were tried, but without any obvious advantage. In other parts of Germany the same   7   •trials were made. In France a new variety, from the dairies of Passy, near Paris, was tried by M. Bousquet in 1830 ; and about the same period the stock at the smallpox hospital was changed. In France, a commission to investi- gate re-vaccination, comprising some of the most talented men, pronounced against it.  Now I have selected a few tables, almost hap-hazard, which seem to show that there is no connection of a causal cha- racter. In the following tables it will be seen that, before vaccination could have been sufficiently widely spread to produce its so-called protection, smallpox declined in severity and in the number of cases ; that, afterwards, it, in many instances, declined at a less speedy rate ; and, only a few years later, when vaccination, if it could exert influence, by its more general diffusion should certainly have stopped the progress of this disease ; we find, on the contrary, a great increase in the mortality. We find, moreover, in several places where vaccination is general to about the same extent, no uniformity in the decrease. Thus : -   Trieste . Bohemia.

In three quarterly returns for the same year, Nos. is - , T9^ and 20, no death from smallpox is recorded as occurring at Taunton. Moreover, we find this further information respecting Taunton, in the Lancet , of July 2, 1854 ; - " At Taunton, Mr White reports that vaccination has become almost extinct, and that, in a population of between 4,000 and 5,000, not one case has offered for vaccination in the last two and a half years''  In order to judge as to the propriety of introducing com- pulsory vaccination laws, it will be well to see what success has attended other countries.  With regard to most of the despotic governments, I may state that, with or without the aid of laws rendering the omission of vaccination penal, the performance of that operation is made essential to the enjoyment of so many municipal advantages, that the general diffusion is pretty universally attained. In Austria, Bavaria, France, Prussia, Sardinia, Lubeck, Frankfort, and Hamburg, the certificate of vaccination is essential to admission to public schools, and, in many instances, to private schools. In Austria, Frank- fort, Sardinia, and Belgium, with Lubeck, no relief is given from the public funds in case of poverty, no admission to alms-houses or orphan asylums, without the certificate of vaccination. Also in Frankfort, vaccination is indispensable to citizenship ; nor is any one allowed to take a servant or apprentice without. The same with regard to apprentices applies to Bavaria, in which despotic country, as well as in despotic Prussia, even the rite of marriage is refused without the certificate of vaccination. In Prussia and Bavaria direct compulsion, by fine, is employed ; the fine in Bavaria increasing every year till vaccination is received. In Austria, if any one is known to the police to be unvacci- nated, they will take him there and then and compel him. In   11   Hanover the law imposes fine or imprisonment. In Sweden a person refusing vaccination is first dragged before a magistrate and reprimanded ; but afterwards, if he continues refractory, fines are imposed and increased until he yields. In France and Belgium rewards are given to those vacci- nators who have distinguished themselves by zeal. In Great Britain, the United States, &c., we have been free, and every man at liberty to discharge his duty as his conscience has directed him.  Now, I will give a few tables to show the results of these forced vaccinations, and it will be observed that, although the scourge has much died out, still it is not vaccination which has caused it ; for, in spite of the most stringent laws, the mortality has somewhat increased since their operation : -   THE TXBOL VOBALBEBG : Annual average    1786  632  Before Vaccination.   1796  415     1806  312     1816  108  After Vaccination.   1836  252     Annual average    Annual average  Years.  smallpox deaths.

Thus we see the failure of the Vaccination laws.  Already Prussia and Wirtemberg are commencing re- peated vaccination, and Heim, Wagner, Funk, Moehl, Rub- lack, and others, are trying to push the same after every 10 or 15 years, although smallpox has been observed, even a few days after this process.  But after re-vaccination, also, Albers, Henke, Edelmann, Locker, Clarus, and others, have still found smallpox, although so comparatively few cases have been tried. I might quote numerous others ; but, feeling enough has been said, I will only add the names of Reil, Pearson, Sedfearn, Ballhorn, Val-Miiller, Stromeyer, Hufeland, Jarandt, Jorg, and Michaelis, who will abundantly attest numerous cases of violent inflammations, ulcerations, fevers, &c., more or less severe, after this operation, as well as paralysis, furuncle, nervous degeneration, erysipelas, and, in fact, diseases of the most loathsome and frightful character.  Dr. Gregory, the Physician to the smallPox Hospital at London for nearly 50 years, gives the proportion of vac- cinated among all the subjects of smallpox that were admitted (being many hundreds) : -  In 1818, 1 vaccinated in every 6 cases.  1819. 1 ,, ,, 5 ,,  1820.1 " " 5 "  1821.1 " " 4 "  1822, 1 ,, ,, 3 ,,  The same authority, than whom there can be no better, says that the most perfect vaccination gives no warranty of protection, since he has seen persons die of smallpox who have had all the marks so usually esteemed infallible. This he says after perhaps 50 years' experience in the smallPox Hospital. He cites among such cases a patient he lost by smallpox in the daughter of the Earl of Cork, and adds that many similar may be found in London. (I quote from Mag : der aulend : litt : der heisk).

The Dr. Schreiber says, in his Grunde gegen die allgem Kuhpockenimpfung ; " In the division of Schiffner in the Hospital at Vienna, I have observed, upon the same individual, the vaccine eruption and the smallpox pustules." He adds a detailed description of some cases.  Five cases at Oebisfelde, being vaccinated the 19th June, took at the same time the vaccine and small - pox disease. - Hufeland Journal der pract : Heilkunde.  At Marseilles, in 1828, a vaccinated child was seized with confluent smallpox, and lost an eye. - Robert Blattern Vari- oloiden Huhpocken.  In September, 1828, three children who had been vacci- nated died of the smallpox, and in June nine persons vac- cinated took smallpox and died. - Robert Tabell : Uebersicht.  In July, on the corpses of three individuals were seen vaccine and smallpox pustules.  Sclioenlein says, Vortesungen fiber allg : und spec : Path : und Therapie. By the side of one another the smallpox and vaccine pustules are seen, each modifying the other.  At Marseilles, in 1848, 40,000 persons took smallpox, of which number 30,000 had been vaccinated. - Rapport fait a l'Academie de Medecine an nom de la Commission de Vaccine pendant l'annee 1828.  At Salon, in an epidemic, the smallpox attacked 200 per- sons vaccinated. - Robert Blattern, &c.  At Digne, in 1827, 664 persons fell ill of smallpox, of whom 478 were vaccinated. - Meme Rapport.  In the Hospital of St. James's, at Leipzig, were remarked in 1832 66 cases of smallpox, in which upon 12 the distinct marks, and upon 29 the indistinct marks, of vaccination, were visible.  According to Clarus, 500 persons were attacked at Leipzig, of whom more than 200 were vaccinated. - Wochentliche Beitrage zur med : und chyrur : klinik von Radius and Clarus.  Dr. Schreiber, at Eschwege, treated in the same year 40 cases, the greater part of whom were vaccinated.   18   In Scotland, in 1818, Thompson observed 484 cases, all vaccinated. - Opinions des med. d'Edinbourg sur la petite verole et la vaccine.  At Vienna, in Austria, in 1831, Clarus says, 195 persons died, and 74' out of 500 individuals at Leipzig. - Clarus und Radius Wochentliche, &c.  In the epidemy at Copenhagen, five out of each 46 vac- cinated died, so that, according to Schreiber, the mortality remained much the same after as before vaccination. - Funke, die ursprungliclie Vaccine.  Numberless observations of eminent phj'sicians prove the fact of smallpox occurring after vaccination the most perfect. Villant alone has collected 60 examples ; Michaelis, Rauch, Dahlenkamp, Schreiber, Henke, Julius, Guntz, and others attest the same, as may be seen in Hufeland's Jour, der Pract., &e. ; Kleinert's Report, 1833; Juli, p. 131 ; Archiv fur med erfahrungen, 1832, Sept., Oct.; Griinde gegen die allg. Kuhpockenimpfung ; Henke's Zeitschrift fur Staatsarznei- kunde, 1832 - 33; Froriep's Notizen, Bd. vi., p. 149; also, 1833, p. 12, April.  Professor Ilenkd (llenkd Zeitschrift) announces that he has seen at Stuttgard many hundred vaccinated persons attacked by smallpox.  Professor Otto, of Copenhagen ( Rust's Magazine ) observed that of six hundred and thirteen attacked with smallpox, four hundred and thirty-eight were vaccinated. Again, in the period between September, 1828, and June, 1830, five hundred and fifty-seven cases of small -pox were admitted into the hospital of this town, of these four hundred and forty -six had been vaccinated.  At Hamburg, Dr. Simon publishes that he is certain that smallpox develops itself upon the best- vaccinated individuals.  Dr. Shoen saw a great number of persons bearing the most perfect cicatrices, with smallpox, and in many the smallpox pustules were upon the very vaccine cicatrices themselves.  Dr. Swift, of the frigate Constellation, observed fifty-nine cases of smallpox on board, and of Wiese, fifty-four had been vaccinated.  Professor Pfaft, of Kiel, had a hundred and ninety-one cases of smallpox, and one quarter had been vaccinated. . In four cases, he says, the vaccine and smallpox eruptions occurred together. The smallpox pustules appearing among those from the vaccine poison.  The Lancet says, May 21, 1853, that, in the public mind extensively, and to a more limited extent in the profession itself, doubts are known to exist as to the efficacy and   19   eligibility of vaccination. The failures have been numerous and discouraging."  The opponents object in several ways to submitting them- selves to become depots of the pus of others.  This subject, they say, but requires examination to be at once despised and cast aside. 1st. By transfusion of animal matter from one to another, the seeds of all the hereditary' complaints of the first are sown in the second, and thus phthisis, scabies, lepra, scrofula, mollities ossium, spinal affections, madness, and a host of complaints are propagated from the impure into the system of the pure. 2ndly. The voluntary introduction of disease is interfering with the wise administrations of the providence of Him who will direct what is best for man to suffer. 3rdly. Vaccination is certainly no permanent protection, and indeed no protection at all. Instances constantly occur of individuals who are vaccinated and have the vaccine eruption going through all its stages, whilst before the eruption has faded away the true smallpox commences its attack, and positively the two diseases run their course at one and the same time. 4thly. Jenner himself vaccinated his first child, but refused to vaccinate the second. 5thly. And although there are many others, I shall finish with this, that in no few cases death is positively the direct and immediate result.  A question of considerable interest is being discussed at the present moment in Paris. It is alleged that vaccination tends both to the moral ahd physical deterioration of the human race. The ai'gument is that both in man and in the lower animals there is a pernicious virus which it is necessary should be thrown off, or it enters into and produces a per- nicious effect on the system. The cow is rid of this by the cowpox, the pig by the swine-pox, and so on, while in man this result is obtained by  smallpox , to the prevention of which, - the shutting-up of the vims , - many diseases, such as consumption and scrofula, may be attributed.  M. le Docteur Verde-Delisle says, " It is perfectly well known that often injurious principles have been inoculated and developed instead of the vaccine matter. How many cases of inflammation of the arm with swellings of the axillary glands, how many abscesses, how many ulcers of malignant character, have been the consequence of  vaccination tion ! How many children have there not died in convulsions a few days after the insertion of the virus ! Where is the medical man who, in the course of his practiqe, has not had to deplore this sad termination? At other times, it is glandular subaxillary swellings that supervene seven or eight days aftbr   20   the inoculation of the vaccine matter, and sometimes in a period much less long." This French savant goes on to say, "that besides these glandular swellings, another consequence is to be feared, - and Jenner himself brought forward the first ex- amples, - viz., one sees the vaccine eruption extending itself, deepening and forming a true phagadcenic ulcer, whose irri- tation causes an inflammatory swelling so severe as to extend to the neck and terminate in true erysipelas." Dr. Husson, secretary to one of the vaccination societies, and one of the most obstinate believers and defenders of the glories of vacci- nation, in his "Treatise upon Vaccination" says, "I have seen extremely distressing ulcers produced by vaccination ; at first the redness was very angry, the heat great, the swelling and hardness of the arm considerable, and a fever was lit up. The ulcers at the end of the sixth day assumed a gangrenous character that sunk deep into the thickness of the arm, and that was only detached at the termination of a month. An acid and fetid serosity came from its ; edges, which caused an irritation to the neighbouring parts." Dr. Ilusson goes on to say that " it often happens that the inflammation is very' extensive from the operation, and that the tissues become very dense and raised above the ordinary level. This inflam- mation, which much resembles phlegmonous erysipelas, pene- trates deep in the cellular tissue, and forms a chain of swellings and inflammation from the puncture to the arm-pit of a most painful character ; there is much heat, movement is impeded, the skin is tender, and the individual becomes attacked with fever. Often, also, much pain and enlargement of the sulmx- illary glands. Frequently this erysipelatous part is covered with an eruption that does not suppurate." " I have seen," he adds, " this erysipelas cover the whole chest and back ; " and Dr. Odier says that in one of his cases it "not only- covered the whole arm, but gained the neck and face, so as to shut up the eye and produce much fever."  Mr Blank, surgeon at New York, gives two cases of death from these results.  Dr. Shew, of America, commenting on a death from vacci- nation, gives the case of a lady whose health had been much injured by the operation. " In two other cases large swellings took place, one in the arm- pit, the other in the neck, lasting several days, and finally breaking out into running sores. By questioning closely we not unfrequently find that children never enjoy good health after vaccination, however firm it might have been before." " Vaccination sometimes endangers life at the time, and in some instances destroys the child. I have myself known most fearful convulsions to have been brought on by it."   21   Professor Bartlett, lecturer on the Theory and Practice of Medicine in the University of New York, on the authority of Barthez and Rilliett, says, " In 208 children that had been vaccinated, 138 died of consumption, and 70 of other diseases. In 95 not vaccinated, 30 only died of consumption, and 65 of other diseases."  Dr. Trail says, "There is danger of inoculating the pa- tient with some loathsome and even worse diseases, as scrofula, &c."  Dr. Schiefferdecker says, " I have seen a perfectly healthy 3 'oung girl, born of healthy parents, soon after vaccination infected with a skin disease, of which the parents of the child, who seemed very healthy, and from whom the vaccine matter was taken, secretly suffered, as afterwards was ascertained."  Dr. Newman, an author favourable to vaccination, ob- serves, " For experience has taught us that the most terrible disorders have been communicated to healthy children from being vaccinated with lymph contaminated with herpes, scrofula, &c."  According to a communication in Frorieps Notizen fur Natur and Heilkunde, the vaccination neither softens the violence of the first attack of fever, nor diminishes its period ; but often makes it more serious, and the vaccination seems to make the eruption more marked.  Schreiber and others affirm, that if the poison be carried about the system, especially to the brain, it becomes mortal. Grunde gegen die allg., &c.  Heim calculates that three-fourths of the inoculations made with lymph direct from the cow fail altogether. When they do take effect, it oeten happens that severe local inflammation is excited, producing irritable sores and glandular swellings. Dr. Gregory adds- " Nor are we at all sure that the ultimate effect, the security of the patient in after life, will be sensibly augmented."  It is beyond the purpose to quote more, as these suffice to show that many reasonably object to vaccination. I will only add, " In Bethnal Green, at 19, Warner-place South, on the 15th of July, the son of a cabinet maker, aged seven months, died from erysipelas, induced solely by vaccination." (I quote from the Registrar-General's Returns.) Must this father be forced to vaccinate or re-vaccinate another son !  . " In Mile-end Town, Lower, the daughter of a gentleman, aged three months, died of erysipelas, induced solely by vac- cination." (Again from the Registrar-General's returns.) And shall we compel this gentleman to vaccinate the daughter he still has to console him ? Can we expect he would obey ?   22   Dave he run so great a risk i and dare we by force defraud him of his natural rights and responsibilities, and still sternly command him to vaccinate his child?  " At the German Hospital, Dalston, on the 30th March, the son of a mariner, aged ten weeks, and the son of a sugar- baker, aged thirteen weeks, died of 'general erysipelas ' and ' effusion in the brain,' " induced solely by vaccination. In ltatcliffe, at 2, Devonport-street, on 0th April, the son of a coal-merchant, aged three months, died of "erysipelas all over the body induced solely by vaccination."  Perhaps it may be as well to add a few cases from the last Return of the Registrar-General : -  " At Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 28th December, a private in Royal Sappers and Miners, aged 18 years, ' smallpox (24 days), exhaus- tion, marks of vaccination indistinct.'  " In the same sub-district, at Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 1st January, a gunner, Royal Artillery, aged 18 years, 'smallpox (10 days), after vaccination.'  " In the same sub-district, at Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 4th January, a sergeant, Royal Artillery, aged 28 years, 'smallpox (18 days), after vaccination.'" - [Return, week ending January 12, 1866.]  " Greenwich ; Woolwich Arsenal. - At Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 14th January, a gunner, aged 19 years, ' smallpox (12 days), after vaccination.'  " In the same sub-district, at Itoyal Ordnance Hospital, on 16th January, a gunner, aged 26, ' smallpox (13 days).' Had marks of vaccination.  " In the same sub-district, at Royal Ordnance Hospital, a bombardier, aged 20 years, smallpox confluent (20 days).' Vaccinated." - [Return, week ending January 19, 1856.]  ,l Greenwich ; Woolwich Arsenal. - At Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 28th January, a gunner, Royal Artillery, aged 20 years, *  smallpox  (22 days), after vaccination.'  "In the same sub-district, at Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 28th January, a private in Queen's Own Light Infantry Militia, aged 16 years, ' smallpox (21 days), marks of vaccination distinct, phlegmon et abscessus (11 days).'  "In the same sub-district, at Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 3rd February, a gunner, Royal Artillery, aged 19 years, ' smallpox (1 month), after vaccination, abscesses in the thigh.'  "In the same sub-district, at Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 2.:'th January, a driver, Royal Horse Artillery, aged 18 years, ' variola confluenta (13 days), marked with cowpox.'" - [Week ending Saturday, February 16, 1866.]  It would be tedious to quote more, or go through the high authorities in America, England, France, and throughout the Continent ; but enough has been said to draw the attention of the public to what is about to be done. See, the poor   23   mother's tears are not yet dry, and her faded cheek has not yet regained its colour, when another child must, perhaps, by this new Act, follow its little fellow to a premature grave with no better comfort than that it died in innocence. Again, the heart-rent mother will have to watch the first day's feverish excitement and the cold chills of the little one ; again, the loss of appetite, and dull eyes, surrounded by their red net- work of blood ; again, see her child toss its tiny arms as the burning pain of that fiery demon erysipelas consumes and devours it.  Is it consonant with our Constitutional liberty thus compulsorily to endanger the lives of any one ? For Heaven's sake let us pause before we pass so infamous a Bill. Let us think a little before we consign even a few among us to the involuntary chance of an early grave. The Lancet itself, that especial organ of vaccination, starts back affrighted, and nervously entreats a little leisure before we plunge into such unseemly legislation, and tells us there is no hurry for what we are proposing. The Royal Jennerian and London Vaccine Institution Report for 1855 repulses the idea with horror, and exclaims, " This legislatorial ignorance has a worse character , it is tyrannical." Let it not be said of England, our land of boasted liberty, that even one of its people died miserably in consequence of compulsory laws. Awake, then, people of England, and consider your own interests and the duties you owe to your country and your families.  Heads of families, wives and mothers of England, this subject concerns you so much, it is right you should form an opinion and protest accordingly. Time, though short, is not yet gone. The Act is not yet a law. Suffer it not to become so - for this Act will introduce vexatious interference into the hitherto sacred privacy of your homes and families, and seeks by force to deprive you of those personal and parental rights and responsibilities which God has made inalienable.   Note. - I must add that if any one would like to go deeply into this matter, he may find it detailed in an able pamphlet, whence I have drawn, entitled " Compulsory Vaccination, briefly considered in its Scientific, Religious, and Political Aspects."
