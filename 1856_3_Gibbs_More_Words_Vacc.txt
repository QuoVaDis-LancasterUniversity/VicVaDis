MORE WORDS 30 0 , ON VACCINATION BY JOHN GIBBS, ESQ. BEING APPENDICES TO HIS LETTER ON COMPULSORY VACCINATION TO THE BOARD OF HEALTH . LONDON : WILLIS AND SOTHERAN, 136, STRAND ; AND 10, LITTLE TOWER STREET. Price 4d. 1856.    APPENDIX A. The following extract may throw some light on the manner in which a system of certification is likely to work : “ CAUTION TO MEDICAL MEN . - On Tuesday Mr. Wakley held a lengthened inquiry, at the Euston Arms, Melton -street, Euston square, into the circumstances attending the death of Mary Meredith, a single woman, aged 25, whose death was certified by Dr. Murphy, of the University College Hospital, who neversaw the patient , but merely went by the symptoms described, as having resulted from cholera, although it was distinctly proved by the evidence of Dr. Glover, of the Royal Free Hospital, that it was a simple case of peritonitis. It appeared from the evidence that deceased was attended in her confinement by Mr. Michel, a student in midwifery of the University College Hospital, who, after her death, described the symptoms to Dr. Murphy in such a manner that led that gentleman to give the certificate of Death from cholera -- duration of the disease, twelve hours. ' The coroner, in summing up, severely com mented upon the practice of medical men giving certificates of death in cases where, as in that, they never saw the deceased party, either alive or even after death . It was a practice fraught with great danger, as the most foul murder might be enacted and go undetected and unpunished . If such a system were continued, the registration office was a useless expense to the country . Several very singular cases, in which certificates of death were given as resulting from Natural disease, notwithstanding they were produced by violence, had come under his notice while holding the office of coroner. In one case a medical gentleman, unknown to the deceased, gave the usual certificate of Natural death ' when applied to by the friends; but, upon an inquest being held in the case, it was discovered that thedeceased party had destroyed his life by cutting his throat. He could adduce many other instances to show the abominable system that was at present carried on as regarded the certifying of deaths ; and he could assure the jury that, ifhe pleased, he could procure, in a very short space of time, certificates of all their deaths, and have them registered as easily. The jury, in returning a verdict of Death A 2    4 APPENDIX B. from natural causes,' strongly commented upon the conduct of me dical men giving certificates of death without having personal expe rience of thecase, and expressed ahope that such a system would be abolished .” — Weekly Times, April 3, 1854. APPENDIX B. I extract the two following cases from the medical journals : -- “ The following case , by John Smith , esq. , M.R.C.S.E., Sheer ness, will, I hope, possess sufficient interest to excuse me for tres passing on your space : “ Mrs. C— , aged 40, was confined on the 21st of April last, being abouteight months advanced in pregnancy . At that time one of her daughters was laid up in the same house with  smallpox , and another daughter had just recovered. My patient had been feverish , and had suffered from pain in the back two or three days previous to her confinement, and on the following day the eruption of smallpox appeared. I immediately removed the child from the mother, and vaccinated it. On the 29th, notwithstanding there were two well formed vaccine vesicles on the left arm, variolous papulæ appeared plentifully on the face and chest, and in a day or two all over the body. The pustules, though very numerous, were small and dis crete. “ Unlike the case related by Mr. Dendy ( the Lancet, June 17) in which there was an entire absence of secondary fever and matura tion, both were present here ; for although, up to the 6th of May, the child appeared to promise recovery, on that day fever set in, evidenced by great restlessness and refusing to be fed. During the next two days many of the pustules burst, and the little patient died on the 8th. “ During the last three months I have attended twenty cases of smallpox . They had all been previously vaccinated, but in each fatal or severe case there was only one vaccine cicatrix .” — Lancet, August 12, 1854. • Report of a case of vaccinia and variola occurring simultaneously. By John Clarke, M.C.R.S., and L.A.C. , Kenilworth. 66 « • Having read in the Lancet, a short time since, the report of an interesting case of vaccinia and variola in an infant, I am indr relate a very similar case which occurred in an adult, consideri chat i to the quæstio vexata of the present day can only be settled by auul iti cated facts. I must be excused mentioning more than the geral     APPENDIX C. 5 outline of thecase, owing to my having omitted to take notes when it occurred . E. C , aged 22, who had been vaccinated in her infancy, was re-vaccinated by me, Dec. 6. On the fourth day no small red spot was visible, consequently I concluded either that the vaccine disease would be retarded in its course, or would not be pro duced at all. In two or three days afterwards I was called in a great hurry to see this patient. I found her in bed very much alarmed, suffering intense pain in the loins. On the third day an eruption appeared, which in two days assumed a somewhat livid aspect, the throat at the same time being highly inflamed, and so constricted that it was with the greatest difficulty she could swallow even fluids. She likewise aborted, and had considerable hæmorrhage afterwards. On inspecting the eruption on the vaccinated arm I discovered two genuine vaccine vesicles, such as you would expect to see from primary vaccination ; this was about the twelfth day after the insertion of the lymph. I was certainly surprised and somewhat dismayed at seeing the worst form of variolous disease occur simul taneously with that of the vaccinia ; suffice it to say, this poor woman died after an illness of six days. (1853.) ” . " If vaccination cannot neutralise a present virus, how can it neutralise, at a far distant date, one which the system has not yet imbibed ? APPENDIX C. A few recent instances of the failure of vaccination are here added, extracted from the returns of the Registrar-General. “ Greenwich ; Woolwich Arsenal. — At Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 28th December, a private in Royal Sappers and Miners, aged 18 years, ' smallpox (24 days), exhaustion , marks of vaccination indistinct .' “ In the same sub-district, at Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 1st January, a gunner , Royal Artillery, aged 18 years, ' smallpox (10 days), after vaccination. “ In the same sub -district, at Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 4th January, a sergeant, Royal Artillery, aged 28 years, ' smallpox ( 18 days), after vaccination .' ” - [Return week ending January 12, 1856.] “ Greenwich ; Woolwich Arsenal. — At Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 14th January, a gunner, aged 19 years, smallpox (12 days) , 6 after vaccination .'     6 APPENDIX E. “ In the same sub -district, at Royal Ordnance Hospital, on 15th January , a gunner, aged 26 years,  smallpox  (13 days).'

" " - [Week ending Satur day, February 16, 1856.] APPENDIX D. The following whimsical excuse is offered as account ing for the failure of vaccination . “ Dr. Tinsley, of Cuba, is said to have discovered that " vaccine virus, after passing through a negro's system, is valueless for the white race.' ” — Medical Times, August 3, 1855. What absurdity will be the next ? Will nobody discover that the vaccine virus is inoperative when taken from a black cow ? APPENDIX E. In his work on homoeopathy, Dr. E. c. Chepmel states :    APPENDIX E. 7 . “ The vaccine matter should be taken from the arm of a perfectly healthy child - one that is free from any hereditary or acquired con stitutional taint, such as scrofula or other kindred diseases, &c. From a neglect of this precaution most serious and even fatal diseases have been communicated to previously healthy children. ” Captain Claridge, author of several scientific trea tises, says, in his latest work on the Water-Cure : “ In the water-cure, judiciously treated , the smallpox is, under no circumstances, attended with danger, nor is the patient reduced in strength , as under any other treatment. • smallpox ,' Priessnitz says, ' instead of being suppressed, ought to be encouraged , as it relieves thesystem of humours that ought to be carried out of it, and is a healthy process. At one period the profession were as much at fault in the treatment of smallpox as they now are in that of cholera. No means were left untried ; but they failed in arresting its ravages. Jenner's discovery was hailed as an intervention of Providence, and he was voted two grants in parliament. If Priess nitz is right, this discovery may be hailed as a curse rather than a blessing. He states that the insertion of poisonous matter into the blood of a healthy subject produces poisonous consequences, is re pugnant to our feelings, and at variance with the laws of nature. This younglady ( a smallpox patient) had been twice vaccinated. Another friend of mine, 46 years of age, caught the smallpox, though he had been vaccinated twice.” Mr. George concludes his treatise on the “ Treat ment of smallpox " with this admission : “ My own experience would declare, that during the prevalence of mild varieties of smallpox, the occurrence of modified cases, after vaccination, is very frequent; so frequent, indeed, as to make it a subject of anxious conjecture, whether the vaccinated would escape with suchimpunity during the prevalence of a malignant and fatal epidemic . " Several able letters condemning compulsion --- some of them denouncing vaccination - have appeared in the Medical, London, and provincial papers, from the pens of Drs. Ceeley, Hor.Johnson, & c ., and Messrs. Rose, Stephens, George S. Gibbs, Simkins, Hibbert, Fraser, &c . One writer states : “ I was nearly killed, when an infant, by vaccination, and after wards brought to death's door by smallpox." " I add an extract or two from Dr. Hor. Johnson's able letters in the Brighton Guardian and Brighton Examiner.     8 APPENDIX E. “ About 1741, alady introduced inoculation as a remedy; and, ac cording to Pringle's and Lettsom’s tables, in London alone 24,549 more children died after the introduction of inoculation in 42 years than in 42 years before ; and yet thousands were ready to swear to the good effects of this same remedy, or prophylactic, that now is branded by the Legislature under the name of felony. “ It was in 1775 that Dr. Jenner made his first observations, and about 1810 to 1820 that vaccination became general over Europe, and enforced by despotic kings and emperors. Now, it is important to bear in mind that the great epidemic was in 1796, so that Jen ner's ideas were promulgated just exactly at that moment when the scourge was declining. We have it laid down as a natural law that plagues or epidemics are subject to be worn out, as are all mundane affairs. The lepra went through the degrees of commencement, vio lence, and gradual decrease. The samewith the sweating sickness, with the black death , with the plague, properly so called , with cho lera, and others. Had any one proposed vaccination, and have had the experiment tried for cholera in 1837; or in 1848, undoubt edly it would have proved as potent in the intermediate periods as vaccination between 1796 to 1838, and more or less since. Before proceeding to compulsory laws, it would be desirable, as Dr. Val. Müller expresses himself, to prove a causal relation between vaccination and smallpox. I have selected a few tables, almost hap-hazard, to show that there is no connection of a causal cha racter. “ Dr. Gregory's evidence before a Committee of the House of Commons in 1832 : IN  smallpox  HOSPITALS : Years. 1826 1827 1828 1829 1830 1831 1832 ......

The bulk of our present medical authorities have lost faith in the perma nent protection contained in the vaccine matter, and before very long their little remaining faith will be also gone. This subject but requires examination to be at once despised and cast aside for ever as a filthy rag . The opponents object inseveral ways to submitting themselves to become depôts of the scabby pus of others. 1st. By transfusion of animal matter from one to another, the seeds of all the hereditary complaints of the first are sown in the second, and thus phthisis, scabies, lepra, scrofula, mollities ossium , spinal affections, madness, and a host of complaints, are propagated from the impure into the systems of the pure. 2ndly. Thevoluntary introduction of disease is interfering with the wise administrations of the providence of Him who will direct what is best for man to suffer. 3rdly.  vaccination  is certainly no permanent protection, and indeed no protec tion at all. Instances constantly occur of individuals who are  vaccinated , and have the vaccine eruption going through all its stages, whilst, before the eruption has faded away, the true small -pox com mences its attack, and positively the two diseases run their conrse at A 3 10 APPENDIX E. one and the same time. Athly. That vaccinators themselves are but gulling the public for the sake of the vile money it draws into their treacherous pockets, and that Jenner himself vaccinated his first child , but refused to vaccinate the second. 5thly. And although there are many others, I shall finish with this, that in no few cases death is positively the direct and immediate result from this terrible prejudice and bigotry , “ M. le Docteur Verde-Delisle says, ' It is perfectly well known that often injurious principles have been inoculated and developed instead of the vaccine matter. How many cases of inflammation of the arm , with swellings of the axillary glands, bow many abscesses, how many ulcers of malignant character, have been the consequence of vaccination ! How many children have there not died in convul sions a few days after the insertion of the virus ! Where is the medical man who, in the course of his practice, has not had to deplore this sad termination ? At other times it is glandular subaxillary swellings that supervene seven or eight days after the inoculation of the vaccine, and sometimes in a period much less long. ' This French > savant goes on to say, ' that besides these glandular swellings, another consequence is to be feared, and Jenner himself brought forward the first examples, viz. , one sees the vaccine eruption extending itself, deepening , and forming a true phagedenic ulcer, whose irritation causes an inflammatory swelling so severe as to extend to the neck and terminate in true erysipelas.' Dr. Husson, secretary to one of the vaccination societies, and one of the most obstinate believers and defenders of the glories of vaccination, in his · Treatise upon Vacci nation, ' says, ' I have seen extremely distressing ulcers produced by vaccination ; at first the redness was very angry, the heat great, the swelling and hardness of the arm considerable, and a fever was lit up. The ulcers, at the end of the sixth day, assumed a gangrenous character that sank deep into the thickness of the arm , and that was only detached at the termination of a month. An acid and fetid serosity came from its edges, which caused an irritation to the neighbouring parts.' Dr. Husson goes on to say that it often hap pens that the inflammation is very extensive from the operation, and that the tissues become very dense and raised above the ordinary level. This inflammation , which much resembles phlegmonous ery sipelas, penetrates deep in the cellular tissue, and forms chain of swellings and inflammation, from the puncture to the arm -pit, of a most painful character; there is much heat, movement is impeded, the skin is tender, and the individual becomes attacked with fever. Often also much pain and enlargement of the subaxillary glands. Often this erysipelatous part is covered with an eruption that does not suppurate.' ' I have seen,' he adds, this erysipelas cover the whole chest and back ; and Dr. Odier says, that in one of his cases, it not only covered the whole arm , but gained the neck and face so as to shut up the eye and produce muchfever .' “ Professor Henké ( Henké's Zeitschrift) announces that he has seen at Stuttgard many hundred vaccinated persons attacked by  smallpox . APPENDIX E. 11 “ Professor Otto, of Copenhagen (Rust's Magazine ), observed, that of 613 attacked with smallpox, 438 were vaccinated . Again, in the period between September, 1828, and June, 1830, 557 cases of smallpox were admitted into the hospital of this town, of those four hundred andforty -six had been vaccinated. “ At Hamburg, Dr. Simon publishes that he is certain that  smallpox  developes itself upon the best vaccinated individuals. “ Dr. Shoen saw a great number of persons bearing the most per fect cicatrices, with smallpox ; and in many the smallpox pustules were upon the very vaccine cicatrices themselves. “ Professor Pfaft, of Kiel, had 191 cases of smallpox, and one quarter had been vaccinated . In four cases, he says, the vaccine and smallpox eruptions occurred together — the smallpox pustules ap pearing among those from the vaccine poison . “ The best authority that ever existed on vaccination is Dr. Gregory, and he says, page 209 of ' Gregory's Lectures on Eruptive Fevers' “ In the years 1818-19, an epidemic smallpox pervaded Scotland, the first that had occurred in these countries since the great epidemic of 1796. During this epidemic, many vaccinated persons passed through a mild form of smallpox. The general confidence in  vaccination  was in no degree shaken. In 1824 smallpox prevailed epidemically in Sweden, and attacked a considerable number of  vaccinated  persons. In 1825 this epidemic visited London ; a great increase of the deaths by smallpoxappeared in the bills of mortality, and many persons vaccinated in early life took the disease. In 1826–27, France suffered from an extension of the same epidemic, which fell with great severity upon the population of Marseilles. Many vaccinated persons went through the modified disease. In 1829, the same epidemic invaded the north of Italy, and was par ticularly severe at Turin . In the same year, the governments of Germany, who had always encouraged and even enforced vaccina tion, seeing the steady advance of the disease towards them, took alarm ; and then began that practice of RE- VACCINATION which has formed so striking a feature in the medical history of the German States for the last twelve years. It commenced in the Royal armies of Wirtemberg. Then succeeded the re - vaccination of the Prussian, Danish, and Baden armies. “ In 1835, the government of Wirtemberg, satisfied with the results of the military trials, extended the plan, and ordered the re vaccination of the entire civil population of the kingdom. “ Ceylon was a British colony when the Government earliest interfered and most vigorously encouraged the practice of vaccina tion . Salaried vaccinators were scattered over the whole island. So successful were their labours, that, up to the beginning of 1819, it had often been said that the experiment of exterminating smallpox had been made and successfully carried out in Ceylon. In July, 1819, however, a severe epidemic smallpox broke out there. În 1830, a second epidemic overspread the island ; in 1833, a third ; and in 1836, a fourth. In these four epidemics 12,557 persons 12 APPENDIX E. were attacked , of whom 4090 died, being at the rate of 33 per cent. , or one out of every three. In each of these epidemics, a certain number of vaccinated took the smallpox. The proportion of the vaccinated to the unprotected varied : in the third epidemic, out of a total of 460 attacked, 341 represented themselves as vaccinated. “ Denmark has undergone several visitations of epidemic  smallpox  ; yet in no country in Europe has more attention been paid to 6 vaccination, both as respects numbers and purity of lymph. The first was in 1824, the second in 1826, the third in 1829. Copen hagen suffered also in the years 1833 and 1835. “ • England experienced the second visitation of this century in 1838, and again many vaccinated persons suffered attacks of this malady. This epidemic commenced in the summer of 1837, and did not terminate till December, 1839. The total deaths throughout England and Wales during that period (two years and a half) by smallpox amounted to 30,819, or an average of 12,200 deaths per annum. Calculating that the rate of mortality ruled about 20 or 25 per cent. , it follows that in these thirty months there occurred in England and Wales not fewer than 154,000 cases of smallpox.” " In a table by Dr. Heim , there occurred 1055 cases of smallpox after vaccination in Wirtemberg and (in a table by Dr. Mobl) 653 in Deninark . “ In Small -pox Hospital, in the smallpox cases after vaccination , Years. 1826-32 619 1833-39 900 : 1840-42 333 : : 1852 “ In 1829 the invasion ofepidemic smallpox and failure of the vaccination induced the Sardinian government to try a variety of new lymphs ; and Dr. Griva , chief of the vaccine establishment of Turin , says not any difference was observed in the new and old. In Wirtemberg, between 1831 and 1836, FORTY new varieties of lymph were tried, but without any obvious advantage. In other parts of Germany the same trials were made. In France a new variety, from the dairies of Passy, near Paris, was tried by M. Bousquet in 1836 ; and about the same period the stock at the smallpox hospital was changed. In France, a commission to investigate re-vaccination, comprising some of the most talented men , pronounced against it. “ Heim calculates that three- fourths of the inoculations made with lymph direct from the cow fail altogether. When they do take effect, it OFTEN happens that severe local inflammation is excited, producing irritable sores and glandular swellings. Dr. Gregory adds: * Nor arewe at all sure that the ultimate effect, the security of the patient in after life, will be sensible augmented .' “ To these I will add a few more cases and authorities, principally from those same countries where there has been so long an experience APPENDIX E. 13 of compulsory laws. The Dr. Schreiber says, in his Gründe gegen die Allgem . Kuhpockenimpfung:' ' In the division of Schiffner in the 6 hospital at Vienna, I have observed, upon the same individual, the vaccine eruption and the smallpox pustules . He adds a detailed description of some cases. “ Five cases at Oebisfelde, being vaccinated the 19th June, took at the same time the vaccine and  smallpox  disease . - Hufeland , Journal der Pract. Heilkunde. “ At Marseilles, in 1828, a vaccinated child was seized with con fluent smallpox, and lost an eye.- Robert, Blattern Varioloiden Kuhpocken. “ In September, 1828, three children who had been vaccinated died of the smallpox, and in June nine persons vaccinated took smallpox and died . — Robert, Tabell. Uebersicht. " In July, on the corpses of three individuals were seen vaccine and smallpox pustules . “ Schoenlein says ( " Vortesungen über Allg. und spec. Path. und Therapie '), — By the sideof one another the smallpox and vaccine pustules are seen, each modifying the other. ' " At Marseilles, in 1848, 40,000 persons took smallpox , of which number 30,000 had been vaccinated.— Rapport fait à l'Aca demie de Médecine an nom de la Commission de Vaccine pendant l'Année 1828. “ At Salon, in an epidemic, the smallpox attacked 200 persons vaccinated . - Robert, Blattern, &c. “ At Dinge, in 1827, 664 persons fell ill of small - pox, of whom 478 were vaccinated . - Même Rapport. “ In the Hospital of St. James's, at Leipzig, were remarked in 1832, 66 cases of smallpox, in which upon 1ž the distinct marks, and upon 29 the indistinct marks of vaccination, were visible. According to Clarus, 500 persons were attacked at Leipzig , of whom more than 200 were vaccinated.—Wochentliche Beiträge zur med. und chyrur. Klinik von Radius und Clarus. “ Dr. Schreiber, at Eschwege, treated in the same year 40 cases, the greater part of whom were vaccinated. “ In Scotland, in 1818, Thompson observed 484 cases , all  vaccinated  . — Opinions des Méd. d'Edimbourg sur la Petite Vérole et la Vaccine. According to Gregory's communication in Froriep's ' Notizen für Natur und Heilkunde ,' the vaccination neither softens the violence of the first attack of fever, nor diminishes its iperod ; but often makes it more serious, and the vaccination seems to make the eruption more marked . “ Schreiber and others affirm that if the poison be carried about the system , especially to the brain, it becomes mortal. - Gründe gegen die Allg, &c . « At Vienna, in Austria, in 1831, Clarus says, 195 persons died, and 74 out of 500 individuals at Leipzig. – Clarus und Radius Wochentliche, &c. " In the epidemy at Copenhagen, five out of each 46 vaccinated 14 APPENDIX F. died, so that, according to Schreiber, the mortality remained much the same after as before vaccination . - Funke, die ursprüngliche Vaccine. “ Numberless observations of eminent physicians prove the fact of smallpox occurring after vaccination the most perfect. Villant alone has collected 60 examples ; Michaelis, Rauch, Dahlenkamp, Schreiber, Henké, Julius, Guntz, and others attest the same, as may be seen in Hufeland's Journ. der Pract., &c.; Kleinert's Report, 1833 ; Juli, p. 131 ; Archiv. für med. Erfahrungen, 1832, Sept., Oct.; Gründe gegen die allg . Kuhpockenimpfung ; Henké's Zeitschrift für Staatsarzneikunde, 1832–33 ; Froriep's Notizen, bd. vi. p. 149 ; also, 1833, p. 12, April. Already Prussia and Wirtemberg are commencing repeated  vaccination  , and Heim , Wagner, Funk, Moehl, Rublack, and others, trying to push the same after every ten or fifteen years, although smallpox has been observed, even a FEW DAYS after this process. “ And after re -vaccination, also, Albers, Henké, Edelmann, Locker, Clarus, and others, have still found smallpox, although so comparatively few cases have been tried. I mightquote numerous others ; but, feeling enough has been said , I will only add the names of Reil, Pearson, Sedfearn , Ballhorn , Val-Müller, Stromeyer, Hufe land, Jarandt, Jörg, and Michaelis, who will abundantly attest nu merous cases of violent inflammations, ulcerations, fevers, & c ., more or less severe, after this operation, as well as paralysis, furuncle, ner vous degeneration, erysipelas, and, in fact, diseases of the most loathsome and frightful character.” APPENDIX F. Another recent French pamphlet, entitled, “ La Vaccination est non seulement inutile, mais dangereuse ,' is a translation by Dr. Zimpfelof a German pamphlet by Dr. Lutze, with a preface by the translator. Here are translations of a few extracts. Dr. Zimpfel a says : 66 Every practical physician whose conscientious efforts are directed, not to treat the maladies of his neighbours superficially, but to cure them radically (which can only be done by discovering thecause of the evil, as far as the fundamental laws of nature permit), is forced to confess that, notwithstanding the inmense progress of medical science in every country, the general infirmities increase more and more, .in a dreadful manner, amongst all civilised people.” — Pre face. APPENDIX F. 15 Dr. Zimpfel attributes this deterioration of the human race principally to the practice of vaccination , and ranges himself without reserve on the side of Dr. Lutze, who says : “ Fifty years have passed since Edward Jenner employed cow -pox as an anti-variolique, and Woodville, Pearson, Odier, Decarro, and others taught, with unrelaxing zeal, to spread the discovery. Be neath our eyes there is a rich harvest of observations and experiences -rich, abundant, and for a long time examined sufficiently to permit a the examiner to form a decisive judgment on a preservative which during all that time has been regarded as one of the conquests of science, so salutary, that unhappily the voices of clear-sighted ob servers were lost in the general jubilation. But science does not stop ; she follows with serenity, but without rest, the path marked out by knowledge, and enlightens us at every step by progres sive discoveries on the defects of hitherto vaunted acquisitions.” ( p. 7.) “ Although inoculation with smallpox partly produced the desired effect, by diminishing the violence of the malady, the evil attending it was not less weighty, that is, the tendency of the persons inocu lated to spread smallpox by contagion made itself not a little felt, 80 that, according to the tables of Pringle and Lettsom , there died of smallpox in London, during the 42 years subsequent to the introduction of inoculation, 24,549 children more than in the pre vious 42 years. Well, the magistrate of the city of Dijon ended by forbidding inoculation, under a penalty of 300 livres. At the same time a degeneration of the virus,and a transmission of other maladies, clearly showed that inoculation was as dangerous as useless. “ In 1775, Dr. Edward Jenner was struck with the experience of some peasants, thatis, of persons who, having milked with wounded hands cows affected with cow -pox, were infected with this malady, but, on the other hand, were not afflicted with cow -pox. He suc ceeded, with indefatigable zeal, in spreading this discovery far and wide, notwithstanding the repulsive idea to inoculate with the humour of a diseased brute. The seeming success raised a hope of the com plete extirpation of smallpox, sothat at length , in some States, the law enforcing vaccination was passed , certainly in opposition to reason, byinfringing the inviolability of the person and constitutional prin ciples. Likewise, vaccination encountered , from the first, the most conflicting opinions.” — (p .8.) “ Dr. Schreiber says in his work , Gründe gegen die Allgem . Kuhpockenimpfung. Eschwege, 1834, p. 15 :- In the ward of Schiffner, in the hospital at Vienna, I observed on the one individual cow.pox and smallpox; both appeared concurrently without being imparted by wilful contagion. The two exanthemata reciprocally modified each other in their course. I experienced a second case of this kind in 1833, in an infant, aged one year, who came to be  vaccinated  . At first, pustules formed in the incisions ; a little later, a 16 APPENDIX F. smallpox supervened, covering all the body with small red spots. The pustules of the incisions progressed as usual, attaining their height on the eighth day, and then drying. The smallpox took eleven days before arriving at perfection, after which it dried. Five children at Oebisfelde, having been vaccinated on the 19th of June, 1801 , took at once cow -pox and smallpox. Similar experiences occurred during the epidemic which prevailed at Marseilles in 1828. A vaccinated child lost an eye from confluent smallpox. In Sep tember in the same year, three children who were vaccinated died of smallpox ; also in June, nine persons having the same disease had been vaccinated. In July, there were visible on three corpses the pustules of cow- pox besides those of smallpox.” — (p. 9.) “ As to the diminution of the virulence of the malady, it is ob served that all epidemics gradually diminish in violence as they re appear at intervals, as the example of cholera shows. Considering also the influence of a heightened culture, and the redoubled and more extended care of physicians, we shall not at all find the results 1 of vaccination satisfactory, as we shall see by and by. Although it is asserted that vaccinated persons seldom have smallpox, expe rience, based on conscientious observations, sufficiently shows the contrary .” -- (p. 10.) " “ According to a letter of Swift, smallpox broke out in Sep. tember, 1831, at the Port Mahon, in the American frigate, the  Constellation ; 59 of the crew were seized with it, of whom 54 had been vaccinated . At Marseilles, in 1828, 40,000 persons took T smallpox, of whom 30,000 had been vaccinated ; 2000 had also had the same disease. At Salon, a variolous epidemic prevailed, which attacked 200 vaccinated persons. At Digne, in 1827, 664 persons fell ill of smallpox, of whom 478 had been vaccinated . In the hos pital of St. Jacob, at Leipsic, they observed, in 1832, 66 persons ill of smallpox, of whom 12 bore the distinct marks of vaccination ; on 29 the marks were imperfect. According to Clarus, 500 persons A & DO wereattacked by natural  smallpox  at Leipsic, of whom more than 200 had been vaccinated, and Dr. Schreiber, of Eschwege, treated in the same year 40, of whom the greater part had been vaccinated. During the epidemy which raged in Scotland in 1818, Thompson observed 484 individuals on whom smallpox manifested itself, al though they had been vaccinated . As, according to these examples (of which we could cite many more), the anti-variolous virtue of  vaccination  is very doubtful, so the pretext has been refuted that small 04 pox is less violent after vaccination .” — (p. 11.) “ The mortality also appears greater in the variolous epidemics observed of late. At Vienna ( in Austria), 195 persons died in 1831 . According to the reports of Clarus, 74 persons out of 500 died at 08 1 Leipsic in 1832. During the epidemy at Copenhagen, 5 persons died of 46 vaccinated, so that, according to the estimate of Dr. an 10 Schreiber, given in his book , mentioned repeatedly, (p. 37,) the mortality has remained at very nearly the same point since the em ployment of vaccination .” - (p. 12. ) 001 " “ Those who believe in the infallibility of vaccination pretend also  APPENDIX F. 17 that the exanthem which follows it, and answers to that of the natural smallpox, is essentially different therefrom . Attributing to vaccination apalliative influence on smallpox, they name that form of smallpox which they say is modified by vaccination, ' varioloid.' In return, a number of physicians believe that they have demon strated the identity of varioloid with smallpox. Nenberg, Sauter, and Robert, observed cases of varioloid which had not been preceded by vaccination. According to Albert, the exanthem named varioloid has been noticed before vaccination . This has been reported by * schaft, Schneider, Naumann, James, Franke, Vogel, Morton, and Swieten. Schoenlein also says : “ The epidemics in Italy and . olland, in 1547, were in the category of varioloids. The numerous uses in which varioloids spring from the infection of  smallpox , sikewise in which  smallpox  shows itself by the infection of varioloid, manifest again very clearly the identity between these two maladies. It often happens that it is not possible to distinguish the varioloids, which follow vaccination, from smallpox, the which has been fre quently observed by Radius, during the epidemic of 1832-3, at Leipsic. Dubois, Dugos, andmany others, make the same observa. tion . “ The frequent appearance of smallpox, likewise of varioloid , after vaccination, causes the presumption that the prophylactic virtue is limited to a certain space of time. Heim , Wagnes, Funk, Moehl, Rublack, and others, pronounce for re-vaccination after 10–15 years, although they remark varioloid and smallpox some weeks, and even some days, after vaccination . Schreiber, p. 16 of his book, quoted repeatedly, mentions nine children who, vaccinated on the 20th July, took smallpox in August, September, and October ; Neabes, Robert, Gregory, Plarus, and Radius mention similar cases. • As there is not the lapse of a day, a week, a month, a year,' says Schreiber, A.D.O., ' that smallpox does not appear after vaccination, 6 what period then should be fixed on for re-vaccination ? ' But even re -vaccination has shown its insufficiency. Without insisting that it often only half succeeds — of 80 re -vaccinations performed by Robert, there were but two that perfectly succeeded — it should be mentioned that varioloids and smallpox have been seen to appear after success ful re-vaccinations, as Albers, Edelmann, Locher, Clarus, and others attest.” — (pp. 12, 13.) “If, by these communications, we are satisfied that there is suffi cient proof of the inutility and absolute uncertainty of vaccination , another question arises, namely, as regards the danger of the pro ceeding. Without regarding particular and local accidents, violent inflammations, ulcerations of the skin, ulcers, fever more or less ardent, after vaccination , Reil alleges that malignant cow -pox is accompanied by violent inflammations, fevers more or less violent, and ulcers difficult to cure. ” —(p. 13.) “ It should be mentioned, at the same time, that exanthematic cow -pox displays, in its diverse modifications, scurf, corroding scabs, erysipelatous inflammations, &c. , noticed by Pearson, Sedfearn, Balhorn, Val. Müller, and Stromeyer. Hufeland, Reil, Jarandt, and  18 APPENDIX F. others, make similar mention of this exanthem , and Jörg communi cates several cases where it degenerates into furuncle, ending in death. Michaelis gives several cases of scurf and corroding scab. Schreiber gives many cases of metastases from this exanthem ;-in flammations of the eyes, affections of the glands and bones, of which even Schoenlein makes mention as the consequence of vaccination . " That during dentition vaccination carries off many children is a fact proved beyond the least doubt, although they attempt to place it to the account of the teeth . The Court physician, Rublack , at Dresden, although a zealous partisan of vaccination, warns respecting this period. This important act, says he, should be allowed to pass tranquilly, unless variolous epidemics should cause every other consi deration to be disregarded. At this time it is greatly to be feared , lest, exacting too much activity from the system of lymphatic vessels by means of vaccination, and the disturbing consequences thereof, a vicious weakness be engendered of which scrofulous diseases are some what later the injurious consequences. Also Schoenlein , as well as Aken, pronounce similarly, and, nevertheless, so many children are vaccinated at that period ! “ Moreover, every year we have distinctly recognised that the vaccine lymph not only is the principle of contagion of simple cow pox, but that it propagates dartres, scab, scrofula , 8—8. Reil has had the same experience The true cow -pox ,' says he, ' can never be transmitted to children who have bad blood , or who suffer from spo 6 radic or herpetic eruptions, producing thereby an exanthem from which proceeds a lymph impregnated with those vicious humours. Schoenlein is likewise of opinion that by vaccination scrofula and s are transmitted to infants in good health . At any rate, the superabundance of scrofula spread everywhere is partly due to  vaccination  ; for, according to the registries of deaths, scrofula carries off more victims than ever smallpox did. For example, at Berlin, in 1833, there were an average of 800 deaths per month, 75 being the prey of scrofula ." -- (pp . 14, 15.) > From the foregoing we may infer that vaccination only protects healthy children , who do not need the protection ; and that it fails to protect children who have impure blood and who need protection , while it daily adds to their number. Onemore extract from Dr. Lutze : “ There are also numerous examples of the communication of soby vaccination. Dr. Evertzen relates a very remarkable one : * An infant, apparently full of health, who had not a single defect in his whole body, but whose mother had been attacked with 8--8, evidently communicated this disease to six children by means of its cowpox. These children infected their mothers, who nursed them. French doctors, especially Ferguson and Raspail, furnish abundant similar examples. Raspail alone observed 60 cases in 1845." (p. 15.)  APPENDIX F. 19 “ Very recently, November 10, 1853, many cases in which, through the medium of vaccination, s-8 had been transmitted to children, and by them to their mothers, were tried before the tri bunal at Bamberg, putting beyond doubt the gravity of the danger of vaccination. Similar cases which occurred at Cologne were com municated by the public press.” — (p. 15.) Dr. Verde-Lisle, another French writer, strongly condemns vaccination in his recent work entitled “ Dégénérescence physique et morale de l'Espèce Hu maine determinée par la Vaccine. ' I make a few extracts : “ The human species degenerates : to the powerful races of past ages has succeededa generation dwarfed, lean, fragile, bald, purblind, whose character is gloomy, imagination dry, wit poor. “ Vainly the governments of all countries pursue the work of amelioration, physical and moral, with the most praiseworthy, the most admirable, solicitude. The species is deteriorated, nature seems to have been arrested in her march, and not to have acquired due develo nent. “ The present generation is the prey of new maladies, and a number of old ones have become much more frequent, more grave, more deadly. “ The intellectual faculties have suffered the consequences of this disorganisation. • The efforts of government are useless ; progress is paralysed ; there is a radical evil which no one sees, which no one desires to see . “ Let us then trace the origin : the sole cause of multiplied disas ters is vaccination . “ The mode of action of vaccinating, which its propagators have exhibited in a manner the most capricious and varied, but of which they have always been ignorant, we expose it proof in hand . “ Those consequences which the introducers of vaccination could not foresee , on which their followers persist in shutting their eyes ; we lay them bare in their desolating multiplicity. “ To discover the origin of evil is to show at once the only means to arrest its progress in the present — to preserve the generations to come. “ In short we trust to give the final stroke to an imprudent inven tion, which now throughout three generations has weighed in a manner the most cruel on the human species. “ This doctrine is strange, and above all it is difficult to cause its acceptance amidst the pretensions of the nineteenth century, to counsel science to retrace its steps sixty years. “ Doubtless the vaccinators will resist; they have on their side sixty years of practice (tragical it is true, but official), and the stupid admiration of the schools ; they have, amongst our brethren, routine -in families, custom ,  20 APPENDIXF. “ We shall have on our side men of intellect, learned physicians, eager for knowledge, who read and study without prejudice ; we shall have every man who reflects. “ This book is addressed to schools, to physicians, and also to men of the world . “ For there is a certaiu number of men of science, some ignorant, others sometimes greatly enlightened, whose logic, instinctively ob stinate and methodically contradictory, resists , on principle, every new assertion , every idea opposed to received notions. This class, always too numerous, seizes public confidence, relies on the duration of errors, if not to propagate them , at least to maintain them, in spite of the progress of reason . They claim, but in an imposing, vain, and often perfidious manner, the merit of having well matured their de cision : they oppose a barrier to new researches, which public con science has often much trouble in overcoming. . “ The fact of degeneration is evident. “ In truth , what can be more extraordinary ? Every day the ge neral conditions of existence improve. The government of every country, especially of France, shrink from no sacrifice where hygienic amelioration is atstake, and yet the race degenerates.” — Preface. I had hoped to be able to add further extracts from Dr. Verdé Lisle, and also from the able works of Drs. Schreiber, Heim, Nicolai, and Nittinger, but can only find room for the titles of those works : “ Erforschung der Alleinigen Ursach des immer häufigern Erschei nens der Menschenblattern bei Geimpften, & c.

G. G. Nittinger, M.D., Stuttgart, 1853.) ”  APPENDIX G. 21 APPENDIX G. It is doubtful if there ever was a society so incom petent to deal with statistics as the Epidemiological Society. It is manifest that they are totally ignorant that the figures upon which they rely as proving the efficacy of their nostrum show clearly that there was a gradual decrease in the ravages of  smallpox  for some years prior to the general adoption of vaccination, and that since vaccination there has been an increase in the ravages of smallpox , and that those ravages are greatest in countries where smallpox is most rigidly enforced . var canoaterra Further, how absurd are many of the statements which this learned society advance as furnishing proof of the value of vaccination ! Take an example or two : “ In the year 1849 smallpox invaded the village of Road, a wretched place, ill-vaccinated ; it attacked 48 out of 800 inhabitants. Four villages, all within two miles of it, with populations of 1200, 230, 190, and 170, respectively, and all in constant communication with it, but where the poor are in better circumstances, and all vacci nated, entirely escaped. " “ In better circumstances ! ” what a pregnant sen tence ! suggesting ideas of better food, clothing, houses, cleaner habits, and better health . Again : “ Mr. Pollock , of Kensington, some years ago saw smallpox in troduced into a village in Northamptonshire by a disorderly woman who brought it from Northampton . She died . All the inmates of the house were immediately vaccinated, not having been so before . Two were attacked with smallpox, while the vaccine vesicle was going through its course apparently well ; both recovered. The whole parish was vaccinated , and the disease spread no further. There had been no small -por in that village for 30 years previously, and scarcely any vaccination ; many of the elderly people had neither had  smallpox  nor been vaccinated.” Surely there can be nothing strange in the death by smallpox of a disorderly woman”—that is , a woman of habits injurious to health —although it may be 66 22 APPENDIX H. strange that two persons should recover from the combined virulence of small - pox and cowpox. But how could vaccination be said to have protected the other inmates of the house when it had not been employed until after they had been exposed to the contagion of smallpox and had escaped ? And what protected the inhabitants of the village for 30 years ? Once more : “ In most ofthe large towns of Scotland, the pauper and labour ing population live in what may be termed barrack -houses ; these consist of large blocks of buildings, of four, five, six, or seven floors, which, for economy's sake, have very commonly but one staircase common to two blocks. Most of that class have but one room per family, or at most two rooms ; so that it is not an uncommon circum stance for from 15 to 50 families to enter by the same common staircase. When an epidemic breaks out in such a block of buildings, it rarely fails to attack all predisposed to it; and owing to this cause, even during the past year (1852) we heard of one instance in which no fewer than four deaths from smallpox occurred in one block of houses entering from the common staircase, whilst almost every indi vidual unvaccinated took the disease. When to thisfaulty construc tion oy the housesfor the poor is added, as is the case in most of the towns in Scotland, the want of ventilation, the crowding of human beings into too confined a space, the faulty supply of water to the houses of the poor, and the consequent want of cleanliness, and in especial the carelessness with regard to vaccination , we cannot wonder that this loathsome disease continues to exist and spread amongst the population .” What, gentlemen and doctors, do you really regard vaccination as capable of neutralising the combined evils of " want of ventilation ," « the crowding of human beings , ” the want of “ water ” and “ cleanli Do you really believe that you can success ness ? fully combat dirt with dirt ? Risum teneatis ! APPENDIX H. The following will show that Mr. Newton was not alone amongst divines in his sentiments : “ Our text (Job ii. 6, 7) , indeed, ascribes Job's distemper to the power of the devil ; but the foregoing verse shows that power to have been APPENDIX H. 23 delegated to him, and limited by Almighty God, who alone being Om nipotent, the powers that be, whether natural or political, must all be derived from Him. It is true He has communicated several parts of his sovereignty to the sons of men, but still the exercise of it will ultimately be resolved into his permission. And it is as true that there are several branches of authority, which He has reserved to Himself, in displaying of which He acts upon prerogative, and with out human intervention. I choose to instance the infliction of diseases, which I will attempt to prove are utterly unlawful to be inflicted by any who profess themselves Christians. Indeed, where the doctrines of salvation are not known, and a regular dependence upon Providence is postponed to the absurd belief of a fatality, there it is no wonder to see men give in to impious or unreasonable practices; but in a country where better principles are established, where God's government of the world is for the most part undis puted , and slavish implicit belief happily superseded by rational inquiries ; in such a place, methinks, men cannot easily be reconciled to a practice which abuses their understanding, as well as insults their religion, and, if the received notions of God's providence be just, has its foundation in ignorance, and must be maintained (if at all ) by presumption. The Holy Scriptures give us frequent instances of God's giving power unto men to heal diseases, and, by his blessing, a power is still continued ; but that one was ever granted to inflict diseases will, I think, hardly appear ; unless in the case of Moses with the Egyptians, and Elisha with his servant Gehazi. But both these cases were miraculous, and of God's own immediate appointment, to vindicate the honour of his servants the prophets, and for the punishment of sacrilege and idolatry, and cannot be drawn into precedent by any not invested with the same character and authority. Men may, and have, invented racks and tortures for each other, but no man, let his crimes be what they will , was ever yet condemned to an immediate sickness, or sentenced to lie languish. ing in a fever, for want of a sufficient authority, which nobody but a present set of adventurous practitioners have of late pretended to assume. It will easily be granted, therefore, that such a procedure, for want of a competent authority, is unlawful : that if diseases, as before mentioned , are sent unto us for the trial of our faith , or the punishment of our sins, He alone to whom our faith must approve itself, and our sins are manifest, has properly the power of inflicting them . Remembering, then , our text, I shall not scruple to call that a diabolical operation which usurps an authority founded neither in the laws of nature or religion , which tends in this case to anticipate and banish providence out of the world, and promotes the increase of vice and immorality. That a modern practice has a direct tendency to all this, I offer the following considerations to evince. A natural or physical power does not always infer a moral one : that is to say, a man cannot lawfully do everything that is in his power to do. Thus we abstain from acts of injustice and oppression, although they may be gainful to ourselves, out of regard to morals, notwithstanding they lie within the compass of our abilities. Thus the Apostle  24 APPENDIX H. adviseth us, " Not to let our good be evil spoken of : ' that is, not to do any unwarrantable action for the sake of any subsequent benefit, because the end, however good intentionally, can never justify in law , nor sanctify in religion , the use of means that are bad to come at it. But, on the contrary, the use of bad means designedly corrupts the morality of the intended good ; for, to make an action good, it is necessary that all its parts be lawful, innocent, and good also ; whereas the depravity of any one is sufficient to denominate that whole action evil. Now the Apostle forbids us to do .evil, though good should come of it, upon pain of damnation , which absolutely prohibits all unjustifiable arts and practices, be the event ever go beneficial and desirable ; so that, although we have a power to give a man a disease, that is, though we know the way how it may be done, since a bare power or knowledge does not infer the morality of 80 doing, till that is ascertained, we ought to forbear all experiments of that sort ; for even uncertainty and doubting, in moral or religious cases, lays a positive,or, at least, a prudent restraint upon practice, because , as the Apostle says, “ Whatsoever is not of faith , is sin . The patient of our text, at the verse but one following, refuses to procure a good to himself at the price of a sin . Had he followed the advice there given him, might, perhaps, have eased him of his present pain , and freed him from future apprehensions, but still the remedy would have been worse than the disease, and what the foolish prescriber would have given for good physic the unhappy patient would have found miserable divinity. “ The good of mankind, the seeking whereof is one of the funda mental laws of nature, is, I know, pleaded in defence of the practice I contend against. But I must profess myself at a loss to find or understand how that has been , or can be, promoted hereby : for if . by good be meant the preservation of life, it is, in the first place, a question whether life be good, or not ; but if it be, the preservation of it will be found as little beholden to this practice as any other invention whatsoever. The confessed miscarriages in this new method are more than have happened in the ordinary way ; and if this be our case now, how much worse must it needs prove if God, for our presumption and contemptuous distrust of his goodprovidence, should suffer this delusion to gain ground, and these physicians of no value, these forgers of lies (as Job expresses it ), to obtain and grow into credit among us. Such , I fear, they may be accounted who so confidently tell us what is impossible for them to know ; namely, that they who undergo their experiment are for ever thereby secured from any future danger and infection. This is a bold assertion, indeed, a and if such experiment were lawful, and consistent with the rules of Christian practice, I could wish to God it were true also. But if neither of these be the case, if the two requisites, prevention and lawfulness, be wanting, I believe I may venture to affirm that the most learned and judicious among the professors of physic will never give in to so destructive a scheme. And I hope the time is coming when these venefici, these spreaders of infection , will be distinguished from those of the faculty, who deserve honour, and not permitted to  APPENDIX H. 25 mingle with them , as the devil among the sons.of God, lest, like the disease -giving practitioner, the harlot whom Solomon describes, they entice us till a dart strike through our liver, and we haste to their snare , not knowing that it is for our life. Besides, I cannot appre hend how it conduces to the preservation of mankind to force a dan. gerous distemper upon them, which possibly maynever happen unto them , and, if it should, may probably be attended with very little, if any, inconvenience, and, as before has been hinted, is no security against future contagion. “ This is unequally to stake a substance against a shadow , to make men run into a real danger lest they should happen to fall into an accidental one, and contributes no more to the preservation of mankind than it would redound to the honour of a well-provided city to invite the enemy and surrender now , for fear lest some time hence they should possibly be surprised and taken. If wenow, thirdly , well weigh this matter in a religious balance, it will cer tainly be found wanting, and deceitful upon the weights. I look upon this matter to be forbidden by the sixth commandment, as lascivious thoughts are by the seventh. For it is always to be sup posedthat a law which forbids a great evil forbids also everything that has a tendency thereto ; for which reason, the very next chapter forbids all voluntary and causeless wounding, mutilation, & c. Because these things go often further than they are designed, even to the taking away oflife ; when this happens, they are tobe considered as no other than a breach of the commandment ; and it is but reasonable to imagine that when God forbade to take away life, He forbade also the commissionof any violence whereby loss of life might probably ensue. Though the homicide be casual, yet if the cause of it be criminal, surely it will be no excuse for it ; for it is observed, that although the effect which follows (if mortal) is beside the inten tion, yet the cause of it being not so, is sufficient to make a man guilty before God ; men being justly chargeable with those effects which are the natural results of those inordinate actions from whence they proceed. It is written , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God ; ' this was our Saviour's answer to the devil, when he would have persuaded Him to the commission of a presumptuous action . There are angels ,' says the tempter, ' to take care of you, 80 that you cannot possibly come to any harm ; then make the experi ment, and cast thyself down .' Now there is no great difference between this of the devil and the temptation which lies before us ; both intimate thesafety of the practice, and both pretend the blessing ofGod ; our Lord's reproof, then, will serve them both. No, ' says he, we must not presume upon God's protection, to expose ourselves to any unnecessary danger or difficulty . If trials overtake us, he to whom we pray not to lead us into temptation will make a way for us to escape, that we may be able to bear them ; but if we overtake them , if we seek for a disease, and so lead ourselves into temptation, we can have no rational dependence upon God's blessing ; it is with difficulty we can sanctify our afflictions in the course of Providence, in the way of our duty , and it is odds but we miscarry under them B 26 APPENDIX H. when we bring them upon ourselves. If God's blessing be withdrawn, it must unavoidably be80 ; and such circumstances wherein we have no reason to expect his blessing are, I think, by no means to be run into . There is also a tempting of the Lord our God, when men rely too much upon themselves,and put their trust in one another, without calling upon God for his assistance, or praying to Him to guide and direct them . Under these two temptations the practice I condemn is fairly to be ranked ; in the former, we throw ourselves off the pinnacle ; in the latter, we lean upon a broken reed , which will go intoour hand and pierce it. And it is but just in Almighty God, when we presume too far, to punish our rashness ; when we misplace our confidence, to visit us for our idolatry . “ And now , upon the whole, what is all this discourse but a per suasive to dependupon the good pleasure of an all -wise God rather than throw ourselves into the presumptuous hands of foolish and unskilful men ; and with David to say, ' Let us now fall into the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are great, and let us not fall into the hand of man .' If we believe that He who made the world does still guide and govern it, and sees and knows every action of our lives ; if we believe the Apostle, who says, God careth for us; or our blessed Saviour, who assures us that the very hairs of our heads are all numbered ; that is the most minute circumstances of life happen not unto us without God's permission or appointment ;—if we believe this, the sense of living under such a kind and watchful government should give us a suitable awe of it, a reverential regard for it, and a a firm and steady dependence upon it. Let me ask the Apostle's ques tion - Do we provoke the Lord tojealousy, or are we stronger than He ? Shall we presume to rival Him in any instance of Providence, find fault with his administration , take the work out of his hands, and manage for ourselves ? A dangerous experiment this, and not to be made with impunity, unless, as we thus pretend to be wiser, we prove ourselves mightier than He. But let us not be deceived with vain expectations ; He whoperfectly knows our frame, knows what is fittest for us to endure ; He who knows our virtues, knows the properest time to try them ; and He who knows our sin, knows also the best mannerhow to punish us for it. Nothing becomes us like submission, which, if it be voluntary, will be graciously accepted and rewarded as a virtue ; if involuntary , it will become our sin , and even at last we must submit. Let the atheist then , and the scoffer , the heathen and unbeliever, disclaim a dependence upon Providence, dispute the wisdom of God's government, and deny obedience to his laws; let them inoculate ( vaccinate ) andbe inoculated [ vaccinated ) whose hope is only in and for this life. But let us, who are better instructed, look higher for security, and seek principally there for succour where we acknowledge omnipotence ; let usnot sinfully endeavour to alter the course of nature by any presumptuous interposition ; let us bless God for the afflictions which He sends upon us, and the chastisements wherewith He intends to try or amend us, beseeching Him to grant us patience under them , and in his good time a happy deliverance from them . Let us remember APPENDIX I. 27 that with Him alone are the issues of life and death, health and sickness. Let the ignorant and the trangressor place their confidence elsewhere, but let us evermore believe, and practise as if we believed, that the salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord, who is also their strength in the time of trouble ; that the Lord shall stand by them and save them, that He shall deliver them out of the hand of the ungodly (and unskilful), and shall save them, because they put their trust in Him. ” - A Sermon preached at St. Andrew's, Holborn, July 8th , 1722, by Edmund Massey, M.A. APPENDIX I. An example of the mode in which medical con ferences are conducted will not be out of place. “ Yesterday Professor Syme spoke at the conference no less than fourteen times, and each time his harangue contained its customary amount of egotism and dogmatism . “ If the manner in which the business was conducted yesterday be a fair specimen of the way in which medical men manage re form matters, no wonder weare so long without reform . Every two were at issue as to the objects of the meeting, and proposedall kinds of illegal and informal resolutions; most of the speakers flatly con tradicted themselves, and each other ; many spoke at least a dozen times, and often five or six were speaking at once. Sir C. Hastings proposed that the conference should nominate a committee ; the reso lution was carried , but no committee was nominated . The greatest incoherence and confusion prevailed, when Sir John Forbes, who might haveknown better, proposed that the meeting should adjourn till nine o'clock, in order that the gentlemen assembled might have their dinners. It struck me most forcibly that they had already dined . “ Dr. Paris attempted to read letters he had received ; he could not make out the writing, and no one could understand his interpre tation of them. Would it not be as well, in order to avoid the waste of valuable time, to have a reader ' possessed of a clear vision, and with an articulate tongue, on the next occasion of a conference ? and 6 a ought not the members of it to be admonished not to intrust the papers on which the discussion is to take place to the care of a clerk who is not to be found when the papers are wanted and the gentle men are assembled ? Half an hour was lost in this manner yes terday. “ After three hours' sitting, and a great deal of talking and wrangling, when it seemed utterly impossible that any definite un.  28 APPENDIX J. derstanding could be come to, and when the speakers did not seem very well to know what they were talking about, or for what purpose they were assembled, Dr. Paris abruptly adjourned the meeting sine die, and in this manner ended the great conference of 1854.” 6 Lancet, April 29, 1854. APPENDIX J. The 26th clause of Mr. Cowper's silly and atrocious Bill proposes to give arbitrary powers to the Board of Health “ to issue special regulations and directions with respect to the steps to be taken for preventing the spread of the disease (smallpox) by re-vaccination or OTHERWISE ! ” Here is a modest demand, and a nice little job contemplated by a Board which pockets some eleven thousand a -year of the public money for doing nothing, and proffers to do a great deal of mis chief by way of showing its activity . I may add that the annual cost to the country of the working of the abortive Vaccination Act of 1853 is estimated by an advocate of compulsory vaccination at 80,000l. ; a writer in the Darlington Times esti mates it at 100,000l. What would the proposed new Act cost ? APPENDIX K. I have received many additional letters to the same purport. The following extracts will suffice : “ Since smallpox appeared in the city (Cork ) there has been a good deal of agitation with the view of pressing the people. to get their children vaccinated. The medical priesthood appear most eager to give their lancets employment, although it appears from our fever APPENDIX K. 29 hospital report for the past year, that out of sixty smallpox patients, no less than thirty -six had been previously vaccinated.” (14th March, 1856. ) “ Westcott, near Dorking, “ March 15, 1856. “ SIR,—Having heard of your worthy exertions to remove the pre judice which generally prevails in favour of vaccination, as a preven tive or mitigator of smallpox, I feel it a duty to give you a few facts in confirmation of your opinion that vaccination is not the good which some people think it to be. “ I was vaccinated directly from the cow by a ' duly -qualified medical practitioner,' who considered that I had the cow.pox 80 fine, and thought me so safe, that he said of me to my mother, ' If ever he catches the smallpox I will be hung. ' “ The doctor's assertion as to my safety has proved utterly false, for in the year 1849 I caught the smallpox, and had it so dreadfully bad that two of my medical attendants declared my case to be the worst they had ever known. For some time my life was despaired of ; I, however, rallied after great suffering, with considerable injury to my right eye, and much pitted and scarred. “ I had one brother and five sisters, one of the latter of whom was also vaccinated . She, too, caught the small -pox about five years ago , and had it very bad indeed. My unvaccinated sisters have been exposed to the infection of smallpox, but have never caught it, nor has mybrother, although unprotected by vaccination. When a play mate of his was once suffering from that disease, my father, being desirous that my brother should have smallpox, sent him to play with his companion for some hours on several successive days, but my brother never took the infection, nor has he had smallpox to this day.You are welcome to make what use you please of this letter, the statements of which I am ready to attest before any of the authori ties of the realm . “ Wishing you much success in your attempts to undeceive the public on this important question , I beg to subscribe myself, 66 “ Yours mostrespectfully, “ GEORGE BOXALL.” “ John Gibbs, Esq. ” “ Dorking, March 18, 1856. “ SIR, -It has given me pleasure to hear of your endeavours to expose the fallacy of vaccination as a preventive of smallpox. An experience of twenty -eight years in the treatment of that disease has proved that, in hundreds of cases which have come under my notice, vaccination has neither prevented, nor mitigated, the virulence of  smallpox . In too many instances I have known it to be the cause of blindness and scrofula, of scurvy, and other loathsome skin diseases. For these reasons, and for the sake of personal liberty, I most strongly object to compulsory vaccination. During the years B 2 30 APPENDIX L. stated, I have treated more than 3000 cases of smallpox (1000 in oculated, and the remainder from infection ) by a remedy as simple as it has proved uniformly efficacious, and might be universally ap plicable ; but onedeath from smallpox has occurred under mycare, that of a child who had whooping cough at the same time. Were my remedy generally adopted, smallpox would be robbed of its terrors, and of its fatality. It was submitted to the notice of Go vernment through the late W. J. Denison, Esq., who was well ac quainted with its success, in 1848, and again in June last, but treated with neglect. I now intend to publish it for the general good, through a petition to the House of Commons, with a hope that it may prove a universal blessing; this to me would be the reward I have hitherto had in relieving suffering,—the luxury of doing good .' Wishing you much success in your attempts to promote the truth on this important subject, “ I am, Sir, “ Yours very respectfully, “ John Gibbs, Esq. ” APPENDIX L. « THOMAS ROSE . " An intelligent working man indignantly exclaimed to me, “ Why, sir, they might as well brand us ! " APPENDIX M. The Royal Jennerian and London Vaccine Institu tion . “ A meeting in connection with this institution was held on the 24th of January, 1854, at the Freemason's Tavern, W. H. Ashurst, Esq. , in the chair. The chairman introduced the subjects to be APPENDIX M. 31 brought forward, by remarking that in all matters connected with human progress every man had a right to that amount of liberty which was consistent with the enjoyment of the same amount by others, and no legislation had a right to interfere to limit that freedom . It would appear from the report that a limitation bad been attempted in the Vaccine Act of last session, and it must be inferred, as all such limitations were injurious, that this attempted limitation would also be. The longer man lived , and the more he observed, added the chairman, the more it was found that the agency of conviction was the great agency by which all mighty movements, permanently beneficial, must be brought about. After the usual routine business was gone through, Dr. Epps read the following Report. During the last year, legislation has been trying to effect what individual conviction alone has the power of legitimately real ising. Vaccination is a good. A majority agree that this is a fact. Like everything that is good, its goodness, if left to work by its own agency , appealing as it does to man in the necessities connected with his bodily conditions, will effect its own diffusion. The misfortune, however, is, that no sooner does a good present itself, and by its goodness gain itself a place in public estimation , than legislators in terfere, and determine to giveto goodness alegal status. These un wisely active men practically declare, we will add to the omniscience of Heaven - embodied in the making the good a good, and in its goodness all potent — the omnipotenceof Parliament. The Board of Managers of the Royal Jennerian and London Vaccine Institution have the belief that a sanction derivable from a good — the good itself being a manifestation of the benevolent will of the Creator, that sanction being strengthened by the benefits to man , from it thus de rived - needs not any parliamentary attestation . The only additional sanction is to be found in the conviction resulting from the good which conviction , once established , is potent for all useful purposes ; and the Board of Managers further believe that any legislatorial im primatur on a good of Heaven's creation and appointment cannot be needed, since a conviction of benefit from the good must in time be established ; and if such conviction has not as yet been established, such legislatorial imprimatur will tend to delay the diffusion of the good by means distinct from its own gooduess - by means which, of necessity compulsory, render impure and ineffective the agency of that goodness. . In the year 1841 the Board of Managers protested against the Vaccination Act then passed by the Legislature : this Act enabling parishes to enter into contracts with medical men to perform vaccination on the poor. In this protest, the venerable Dr. Labatt, the manager of theVaccine Institution in Dublin, joined. Both protesting parties predicted the result would be that many persons vaccinated by these vaccinators would be certified as pro tected by vaccination when they really were not so : and would thus, if exposed to small -pox, become, by the carelessness resulting from the belief of their safety , easy victims to the disease, and thus would do damage to the cause of vaccination, inasmuch as they would re ceive smallpox after vaccination, but improperly so called . It was 32 APPENDIX M. imagined by the advocates of the Act that it would fulfil every ob . ject connected with the diffusion of vaccination. The result not having tallied with the expectation of these zealots, who seek to makepeople healthy by Act of Parliament, they forth with seek ad ditional legislatorial interference, and proceed to make people take the benefit which Parliament, inits omnipotence, had provided, and they, during the last session of Parliament, hastened through the Legislature another Act, by which everychild is compelled to be vaccinated. It seems strange that Lord Lyttelton, who parentaged the Vaccine Act of last session, should have acted so contrary to the teachings of his late chief Sir Robert Peel. This great statesman , when some one proposed to make vaccination compulsory, as it is made in some despotic countries, objected, remarking that such a proceeding would be so opposite to the mental habits of the British people, and the freedom of opinion in which they rightly gloried, that he could be no party to such compulsion . ... Who, how ever, can doubt that, of late years the belief in the efficacy of  vaccination  has been shaken ? The Board believe the existence of this doubt has arisen from the circumstance that modern vaccinators have not exhibited the care, andhave not pursued the directions, of Jenner, and of his successor Walker. The Vaccine Act of 1840 further added to this disrepute, as it put into the hands of individuals who did not understand perfect vaccination the act of vaccinating. It is now attempted to set aside this disrepute by compulsory legislation, instead of trusting to the re -establishment of the excellence of  vaccination  byre-establishing vaccine in all itsperfectness. . .The futility of legislatorial interference in establishing a good is seen in theresult, that such interference is generally unwise andfrequently ineffective. This ignorance on the matter of vaccination on the part of legislators when presuming to legislate on the subject is highly disgraceful. . . This legislatorial ignorance has a worse character : it is tyrannical. . What a lamentable state of things is exhibited here ! If Lord Lyttelton brought in this Act without obtaining medical advice, how deficient in the care requisite in a legislator was he ; if he had advice, how ignorant must have been his medical advisers ! The Board of Managers protest against such legislation. It has been asked, Why should not Parliament in terfere in reference to vaccination ? Parliament interferes and makes people construct sewers and drains. It is so ; and Parliament has caused by its legislation all the manure of great cities like London manure which might fertilise the acres of England, and render those acres tenfold more productive - to roll into the river Thames, and thus, as has been rendered probable by the elaborate statements of the Registrar-General, has made the river the poisoner of those that drink its waters, the poisoning power being in exact relation to the quantity of manure poured in — the Thames water supplied from the river above Kew being less destructive than that supplied from the river at Chelsea, and that being less destructive than that supplied from the river near London Bridge. ASother point of view in which the injuriousness of the Act of last session becomes apparent is this : APPENDIX M. 33 the Act requires the Registrar of Births to give to the parent or guardian who brings the child to be registered as to its birth a notice to have the child vaccinated. The effect of the registry of births being identified with the vaccination notice will injure the operation of the Act of Registration of Births. Any parent who disapproves of vaccination (and it is worthy of note that Dr. Gregory, who for nearly half a century practised vaccination , and presided as well over the  smallpox  Hospital, had , before his death, great doubts re specting vaccination and its protective efficacy) will avoid registering his child, and thus a most valuable agency will beinterfered with. It may be urged, that if a parent does nothave his child's birth registered , and thus escapes the reception of the notice from the Registrar of Births to have his child vaccinated, some neighbour will inform the Registrar of his neglect, and thus the law will lay hold of him. What, then, will result ? The establishment of a system of espionage, and the consequent creation of an immense amount of ill- will. Such a state of things is quite unsuited to the horizon of Great Britain . It may pass in despotic countries, where the size of coffins, and the route the funeral cortège must travel, are laid down by bureaucratic interference, but this meddling of the executive — this spy system is not as yet recognised in England. Supposing such a system should spread , and a parent refuses to have his child vaccinated. He is in formed against ; he is fined ; he will not pay; his goods are seized ; they are not sufficient to pay the fines (and the fines laid in the Act are cumulative) : he is imprisoned. The child is deprived of his parent; the wife of her husband. What happens ? A reaction in his favour is produced ; the informer is hated ; the law is looked upon as oppressive ; a dogged resistance is created against the law ; and vaccination, that has worked its way hitherto, and will work its way if properly practised, gets an injury that years will not heal.” In their Report for 1855 the members of the In stitution reiterate their objections to compulsion ; one extract will suffice : “ The Board have watched with considerable interest the opera tion of the Vaccine Acts; and though they have tried to view them in an unbiased point of view, their conviction, already expressed in previous reports, that legislation in reference to vaccination is an evil, has been more and more confirmed .” Dr. Epps, in addressing the meeting, spiritedly de manded “ Are we to have another Wat Tyler insurrection, produced by the dissatisfaction created by medical spies forcing their way into family circles and baring the arms of children , determined to inspect these arms whether or not the parents be willing ? Are we to be driven to the necessity of being subjected to the meddlesome interference of officials ? Are our doors no longer to be shut against all but whom we choose to admit ? Are we to have Austria transferred to Eng 34 CONCLUSION. land ? ... The late Sir Robert Peel thought differently : he main tained, when application was made in Parliament to make vaccination compulsory, that such a procedure was not in accordance with the spirit of the institutions under which the people of Great Britain lived, and was in opposition to the freedom of action so characteristic of the British people. ” CONCLUSION. I now take leave of this subject in the words in which, more than two years ago, I began this discus sion in the columns of the Morning Herald : “ Passing by the facts that the advocates of vaccination have never proved that smallpox is necessarily a fatal disease ; or that  vaccination  is an assured and the sole preservative against smallpox ; or that vaccination is a safe operation, unattended with permanent in jury to health, or loss of life ; and also setting aside the facts that no statistics have been presented to us, showing the relative average mortality from smallpox and from other diseases, and the average duration of life amongst the vaccinated and the unvaccinated respec tively ;-setting aside all these facts, surely it is manifest that it would be a gross injustice, a grievous domestic tyranny, and a dan gerous precedent, to force upon those who dissent from it, not igno rantly, but upon thoughtful and anxious inquiry, the adoption of any peculiar medical practice, although its advocates should be sus tained and incited bya profession once as violently clamorous against it as they now are in demanding its enforcement.
