VITAL STATISTICS.   smallpox  & VACCINATION  IN THE  UNITED KINGDOM  OF  GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND  AND  CONTINENTAL COUNTRIES AND CITIES,  WITH TABLES COMPILED FROM AUTHENTIC SOURCES.  BY  CHARLES T. PEARCE, M.D., M.R.C.S. Eng.  AUDE SAPERE.  DEDICATED TO THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT.  THE LONDON SOCIETY FOR THE ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY VACCINATION, 114, VICTORIA STREET, WESTMINSTER, S.W.  E. W. ALLEN, 4, AVE MARIA LANE, E.C  1882, DEDICATION.  To the Most Noble the Peers of the United Kingdom in Parliament, and to the Honourable Members of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  My Lords and Gentlemen, -  In dedicating the following volume to you, I am encouraged by the hope that its contents may be accepted as a humble attempt to strengthen and confirm the facts which I had the honour to place before your notice in a letter to the Right Hon. G. Sclater-Booth, in the year 1877, a copy of which I then for- warded by post to each Member of both Houses of Parliament, calling attention to the failure of Vaccination to prevent  smallpox , as well as to the dangers attending the practice.  Parliament having passed several Statutes to enforce Vacci- nation, I am encouraged to hope that Parliament will seriously re-consider the subject, and advise Her Majesty to order a Royal Commission of inquiry - more especially as the Legislature is not in possession of all the evidence which has accumulated since the year 1853, when a report was presented to both Houses, drawn up by a small Medical Society, upon which " Report " an Act was passed to enforce Vaccination under penalties or imprisonment.  IV  DEDICATION.  I humbly submit the following pages to your consideration, and feel justified in so doing, under the apprehension that the peace of the country is endangered by the accumulating resist- ance on the part of parents of both sexes, to a law cruelly and tyrannically imposed under the existing " Acts " by Boards of Guardians at the dictation of interested officials - paid agents - to violate the sanctity of conscience, and the homes of a loyal and law-abiding people; while magistrates who have properly been called a " terror to evil-doers ," have a new Statutory function to fulfil in committing parents, who have done no wrong to prison, there to associate with thieves and criminals of every type.  I feel convinced, My Lords and Gentlemen, that when the facts concerning Vaccination are known in all their bearings and relation to the life and well-being of the nation, you will arrive at the conclusion, that to retain in the Statute-book an Act compelling submission to a dangerous operation, under fine and imprisonment, is discreditable as well to hereditary, as to representative, Parliaments ; and that you will in due time, after fair inquiry, repeal those Acts.  I am, my Lords and Gentlemen,  Your obedient Servant,  CHARLES T. PEARCE.  PREFACE.  The following Essay is a continuation and extension of the text and figures contained in a letter which, in the year 1877, the Author addressed to the Right Hon. G. Sclater-Booth, M.P., then President of the Local Government Board.  Therevealment therein of the fact that in England and Wales, each epidemic visitation of smallpox had increased in severity concurrently with the extension of vaccination, appeared so astounding to the Right Hon. gentleman and his associates in the Department of State Control of Local Government of which he was the chief, and so astounding to a goodly number of the profession to which the Author has the honour to belong, that hints of doubt were heard of the credibility of the statistics. They were, however, proved to be indisputable, being attested at Somerset House, in the office of the Registrar-General.  The subsequent general acceptance of the " authority " was so strongly manifest throughout the country, that the Author received letters from many parts of the kingdom, expressing a hope that he would continue the series of statistics which he, in the opinion of the writers, had so well begun.  VI  PREFACE.  The Author is himself congratulated in knowing that the first effect of his pamphlet was to shake the faith of many in the prophylactic power of vaccination, and to confirm the faith of those who had previously abandoned their belief in the dogma.  The dangers attending vaccination, briefly alluded to only, in his letter to Mr. G. Sclater-Booth, vastly increased the number of objectors, and led to a demand by the people for " safe " lymph. Vaccinators and private practitioners have been addressed by parents in unmistakable language, such as - "For heaven's sake let my child have pure lymph !" While others, forced by law to submit their children to the operation, have cried out, "Is there syphilis in the matter l "  The primary object of the Author in submitting to the atten- tion of Parliament and the people, the contents of the following Essay, is to make known that what is true of the United Kingdom, is also true in regard to all other vaccinated coun- tries, particularly those to which attention has been directed as being the "best" and "most" vaccinated countries, viz., Sweden, Denmark and Prussia.  The reader will observe in the following pages that  vaccination tion as a prophylactic against smallpox utterly breaks down in each epidemic, although enforced by most stringent laws. The text is illustrated by a series of Tables (all authentic) which, it is hoped, will be patiently and attentively perused  PREFACE.  Vll  while the whole contents of the volume will serve as a book of reference for all Europe.  The Author, a Vaccinator from the year 1846 to 1856, was led in the latter year, to abandon the practice, on becoming convinced, by studying its history and nature, that the practice was a failure, and an unmitigated evil, a conviction completely confirmed by extensive experience and observation at the Royal Jennerian Institution and in private practice.  From then until now he has never halted or faltered in labouring through "evil report" and good report to do all that is possible in order to accomplish the paramount object of his life, viz., the repeal of all " Vaccination Acts," and thus effect the salvation of innocent victims from the infliction of a disease transferred from the brute creation to th o. genus homo.

PART I.- LONDON.  In the Report of Mr. Simon, then Medical Officer of the Privy Council and Local Government Board, No. IV., New Series, 1S75, there appeared at page 64 the following passage : -  "About twenty years ago (1853) the Epidemiological " Society of London communicated to the Home Secretary " [Lord Palmerston] a report* of an extensive inquiry which " had been made by them into the state of smallpox and vac- cination in England and Wales, and other countries, in which " they showed that the then average proportionate smallpox " mortality in England and Wales was considerably more than " double the smallpox mortality of any of those European " States in which vaccination was, directly or indirectly, com- " pulsory ; and that the mortality in Scotland and Ireland was "much greater even than that in England. This report, which " was subsequently presented to, and printed by order of "Parliament, supplied the arguments on which the first  " COMPULSORY VACCINATION LAW IN ENGLAND, A LAW WHICH "HAS BEEN SINCE MUCH AMENDED, WAS ENACTED IN 1853."  These are the words of Mr. Simon. That report was ordered by the House of Commons to be printed on the 3rd of May, 1853, and by the House of Lords, on the 27th of June, 1853, and immediately followed by an Act of Parliament, which was  * Ordered to be printed by the House of Commons, May 3rd,  1853, and by the House of Lords on the 27th June, 1853.  B  FIRST COMPULSORY ACT PASSED.  passed on the 20th August, near the end of the Session, at a late hour, when a few members only were present. No time was allowed to the members or the public to consider a bill, which, in a few weeks, was to give power to the magistracy to fine, and in default, to commit to prison any subject, however loyal, who refused to bow down to the dogma of the interested promoters of the bill.  For no offence against Society - for no crime committed - a parent was to be cast into gaol, without trial by jury, in viola- tion of constitution law.* The Act was passed on the 20th of August, and applied to all children born after the first of that month.  Thus was a bill promoted by an obscure Society, urged by paid officials in the interest of the fraternity which they repre- sented, forced upon the Government of the day, and quickly imposed upon the people.  That the few who were " The Epidemiological Society " believed that smallpox had become less fatal on the Continent in consequence of vaccination, I have no reason to doubt  The " Epidemiological Society " also thought a compulsory enforcement of vaccination in this country would lead to a similar (supposed) result as that which appeared to be the result of compulsion on the Continent, but the haste with which action was taken by the Government was wholl)'' unjustifiable, the undue haste with which the bill was introduced and passed through both Houses of Parliament, between the 27th of June, and the 21st of August, is unworthy of a representative Govern- ment in respect to any measure which interferes with the liberty  * J udge Blackstone in his able commentary on English law stated that it is the glory of England that no one could be com- mitted to prison except for felony, without trial by a jury of twelve of his countrymen.  INCREASE OF smallPOX.  3  of the subject. " The argument supplied by the report on which the Act of 1853 was based" was fallacious, and I hold that the State has no right to continue in operation a law based on false deductions, and I submit that when " the argument " is proved to have been fallacious, it is the duty of Parliament to repeal the law. Had an efficient inquiry been instituted by a Royal Commission, the Compulsory Act of 1853 would not have been passed. It was passed, however, notwithstanding the promise of the Government that enquiry should precede any further legislation on the subject.  In my Vital Statistics, No. I., which I addressed to Mr. Sclater- Booth, a copy of which I transmitted to every Member of the Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament, I called attention to the serious increase of smallpox mortality in England and Wales in each succeeding epidemic since the said Act of 1853 was passed, demonstated in the following table, compiled from the official returns of the Registrar-General for England and Wales : -  In the first epidemic after the Act came into operation, viz. in the years  1857-8-9 the deaths from smallpox were 14,244  1863-4-5 (the second epidemic) they rose to ... 20,059  1870-1-2 (the third epidemic) they reached 44,840  So that, notwithstanding the very considerable increase in the number of vaccinations, the disease advanced in an increasing ratio.  Indeed, while the population increased between the first and second epidemics seven per cent., the deaths from smallpox increased forty per cent. ; and while from the second to the third epidemic the population increased ten per cent., the  smallpox  deaths increased no less than one hundred and hventy per cent.  4  SIR THOS. WATSON, M.L>.  If we take two decennial periods from the passing of the compulsory law in 1853 we find the smallpox  Deaths from 1854 to '63 were 33,515 and from 1864 to '73 " 70,458  The foregoing figures were so startling and unexpected that from one end of the United Kingdom to the other, there has grown up an active inquiry into all statistics put forth by the advocates of vaccination. It is thus seen, at a glance, that the progressive mortality from smallpox in an increasing ratio under this compulsory law, falsified the glowing statements put forth by so-called authorities, " that vaccination was an effectual preventive of smallpox."  The intelligent classes are now giving that attention to the subject which must irrevitably lead to a more determined resistance to the law, while the Medical profession to a large extent have manifested their misgivings as to the efficiency of vaccination, and expressed doubts as to the justice of a law which compels parents to submit, or be fined and imprisoned. Among those are Sir Thomas Watson, who, in an article in a number of the Contemporary Review , says : -  " I can readily sympathise with and even applaud a " father who with the presumed dread or misgiving in his " mind, is willing to submit to multiplied judicial penalties " rather than expose his child to the risk of an infection so " ghastly."  When in the year 1871 Mr. Simon was examined by the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the  vaccination tion Acts in answer to question, No. 3052, he said : -  " Taking ail ages below go, about two and a half only arc " unvaccinated  Mr. Simon being further questioned as to the data he pos- sessed for this statement, replied to question 3049 thus : -  INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS.  5  " In the London recruit examinations in the three years,  " 1866-7-8, there were 14,727 examinations, and the results in " round numbers were these : that six per cent, had marks of " smallpox, 915- per cent, had marks of vaccination ; that, there- of ore, only the remainder, or 2j per cent, were unprotected  These were young men who came from various places to enlist in the army.  The same witness (Mr. Simon) in answer to the question, No. 3045, said  " In the year 1863, when there was prevailing a less general " vaccination than at present prevails, Dr. Seaton and Dr. " Buchanan inspected the schools of London with reference to " this question, and obtained results which are contained in the " appendix to my sixth annual report. They examined nearly " fifty-three thousand children, mostly between 3 and 1 2 years of " age. The upshot of their figures was this, that about 95 and " 2 -thirds per cent, were protected, namely about one per "cent, by previous smallpox, and the remaining 94§ per " cent, by vaccination, and that only about 4^ per cent. " were unprotected."  To the next question put to him by the Committee, Mr. Simon gave the following answer : -  "Of nearly 50,000 vaccinated, only 508 were found with " doubtful marks. The children who were examined, were " about an eleventh part of all the children of the same age."  So that, according to Mr. Simon, of half a million of children, only five thousand could be found with doubtful marks. That was in the year, 1863. They varied in age between 3 and 12 years, so that, by this time, the youngest would be 21, and the eldest, 30. These 50,000 are now, if living, 50,000 men and women. Is it surprising that the diluted  0  mr. simon's prediction.  smallpox filtered (it is said) through the cow, was so much smallpox seed, which now crops up as smallpox ? *  In the year, 1857, a quarto volume of "Papers relating to the history and practice of Vaccination," compiled by Mr. Simon, who was then Medical Officer to the Board of Health, was presented to both Houses of Parliament. At page lxviL of the letter of Mr. Simon, which forms the preface to the " Papers," I find the following venturesome statement : -  "By vaccination properly administered , the once enormous " fatality of smallpox may he reduced almost to nothing.  At page lxx. a still more astounding statement is made : -  " Henceforth it [vaccination] was to be counted among  " THOSE CONDITIONS, NECESSARY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF  " life, which a parent should not be entitled to withhold, any " more than food or clothing from his offspring."  A preposterous statement. Further on at page Ixxxiii. Mr. Simon, speaking of Dr. Jennerand his process, says : -  " To arm mankind against the worst of pestilences - to widen " by one discovery the horizon of human life - to banish a cruel " terror from every mother's heart - such was Jenner's aspiration "in his study of nature. Such has been the fruit of his  " PHILOSOPHY."  Where ? let me ask, has vaccination widened the horizon of human life? Where the "fruit of his philosophy ? " Facts which I have placed before the Local Government Board and the country, with those which follow in this letter, completely prove that Jenner's aspiration has not been confirmed. Human life has not been prolonged. Mortality has not diminished. The " millions of lives saved " by vaccination are no where existent. The " terror of every mother's heart " has been exchanged for a much more afflicting terror. Not that of a natural disease which !i< See the chapter on Lymph.  CONGENITAL LIABILITY.  7  was then and is now the offspring of dirt, of body, of house, of city ! ! The present terror to mothers is the Law, the Lancet, and the Lymph, a terror not alone of that disease of uncleanness - cowpox, but, alas ! as the facts placed before the notice of Mr. Sclater-Booth in my letter undeniably proved a terror of disease of immo- rality and shame, conveyed to the mother's infant through the lancet, in the hands of licensed and appointed agents, and enforced by the State by a law, cruel, persecuting, and wicked.  The vaccine theorists ignore one of the most important facts in reference to susceptibility. It is assumed that every child possesses a " congenital liability " to smallpox. Hence if a vaccinated child gets smallpox and recovers, its recovery is attributed to the protective power of vaccine ! If, on the other hand, the vaccinated patient who dies is a child, they at once exclaim, " It was bad vaccine," or, " badly done." Again, if the patient is a youth, and has passed infancy, it is immediately accounted for by the vaccination having " worn out," and should be done again. And this in the face of all experience and observation of failure.  In the 30th report of the Registrar-General, page 215, Dr. Farr very pertinently remarks : -  " smallpox, as a general rule, occurs only once in life. Some " children enjoy an immunity against an attack. They cannot be " vaccinated, they cannot be inoculated. Others are infected " by the slightest exposure; and under infection, some take the " disease slightly, some malignantly - fatally."  This opinion of Dr. Farr coincides with the observations of 250 years in England.  I have already stated that the Compulsory Act of 1853 was founded on the erroneous conclusions of the Epidemiological Society. In the first place, the report of the Vaccination  8  SIR' DOMINIC CORRIGAN, M.D.  Committee of that Society contained the following assumption :  " i st. - smallpox is a disease to which every person is liable, " who is not protected by a previous attack, or by vaccination."  To suppose that everyone born into the world is liable to smallpox, is to suppose that which is not true. It is no more true than that every child must have measles, or that everyone must have scarlatina, whooping cough, typhoid fever, or any other of the Zymotic diseases. The next statement made in the said report was, that as : -  " ist. - Every case of smallpox is a centre of contagion ; " and  "2nd. - That as every unvaccinated or improperly vacci- " nated population is a nidus for the disease to settle in and " propagate itself ; therefore, on these two propositions, we con- " ceive must be based any enactments for rendering vaccination " compulsory."  The Committee then proceeded to say that vaccination is a perfectly safe and efficient prophylactic against smallpox. Fur- ther they say : -  " We hold this proposition to be proved by the general immu- nity of the vaccinated ; "* and  " 2nd. - By the gradual decrease which has taken place in " the mortality from smallpox, as compared with the mortality " from all causes since vaccination has been introduced."  * This " general immunity of the vaccinated " is not borne out ; the fact being that from 84 to go per cent, of smallpox cases admitted into smallpox hospitals are found to have been vaccinated.  Sir Dominic Corrigan, M.D., when acting as one of the Com- mittee in 1871, on the Vaccination Act, said that, "an unvacci- nated child was like a bag of gunpowder, which might blow up the whole school, and ought not, therefore, to be admitted to a school, unless he was vaccinated."  vaccino-syphilizEd.  9  The fallacy of supposing that vaccination is " perfectly safe " has been demonstated again and -again from the time of Jenner, by his contemporaries, down to the demonstration furnished by thehighest authorities of experience, recently. How, therefore, can a practise be perfectly safe when it is admitted, yea, estab- lished not only that syphilis is transmissible in vaccine lymph, but that the child from whom the lymph had been obtained appeared remarkably healthy, and manifested no signs of the disease until after vaccination had completed its course ; this was the case in the shopmen and girls in a West-end Drapery Establishment in London, who were syphilized by vaccination, tyrannically enforced upon them by their proprietor, on pain of dismissal from his employ if they refused. The second fallacy is presented in the second proposition, /.<?., that " vaccination is an efficient prophylactic against smallpox." This assumption first put forth by Jenner as an a priori statement, and disproved a thousand times during his life was re-asserted in 1853 by those Epidemiologists, fifty years after Jenner got his nostrum adopted by Parliament.  This assertion is the more extraordinary from the fact that one of that committee, Mr. Marson, was surgeon to the Highgate smallpox Hospital, and knew its failure as a prophy- lactic ; besides which the writings and experience of such men of eminence as Dr. Copland and Dr. Gregory must have been known to them. Yet that Committee, with Mr. Simon, made a " cat's paw " of the late Lord Lyttleton who introduced the bill of 1853 to the House of Lords. The declared object of that Act is not yet, nor ever will be established, viz., "To leave no one in the country unvaccinated." Indeed the bill which was drawn provided much more terrible tyrannical provisions than that which the Act contains. It was proposed that the Public Vaccinator should be empowered to enter any man's house,  JO  DECLINE OF smallPOX AND OTHER FEVERS.  examine his family arms, i.e., the arms of his family up to 16 years' of age, and failing to find the marks of previous vaccination, should forcibly perform it on the spot, and violent advocates of vaccination, including Lord Salisbury, have said that vaccination will never be complete until the policeman is sent with the vaccinator who should seize the child - snatch it from the arms of its mother - and "do the operation."  The fallacy put forth by the Society referred to - on which the Act of 1853 was based, was this : -  That the decrease of smallpox since the practice of  vaccination tion was introduced, was attributable to vaccination.  That that statement was a fallacy I demonstrated in my evidence before the Committee of 1871, in which I show r ed by a number of indisputable facts, that there was a general subsi- dence of smallpox towards the end of the last century all over Europe, wholly independent of vaccination, this arose from an unknown cause and a known cause.  The unknown cause is that which controls and regulates the visitation of severe epidemic diseases, borne by the human family. Over that cause we have no control. Plague, dysentery, elephantiasis, sweating sickness, leprosy, and other forms of malignant fever prevailed at given intervals in the last and previous centuries - they died out and are gone, but who shall say that they will not return, unless guarded against by strict regard to the sanitary condition of our cities and towns.  smallpox had subsided gradually all over Europe as well as in England, before vaccination was thought of. The introduction of the practice of inoculation towards the mid- dle of the last century increased the mortality to nearly double - from 56 to 96 per thousand deaths. The practice gave new life to smallfox, and killed the victims. It spread the  INOCULATION A PENAL OFFENCE.  II  disease all over England and to a considerably later period, until at the beginning of the present century everybody had had smallpox. No wonder that pitted faces were so common fifty years ago !  Those pitted faces resulted from interfering with smallpox by artificial means. The practice of inoculation strongly recommended by the College of Physicians* in 1754, and practised everywhere, is now, by the Act of 1840, a penal offence, and a month's imprisonment inflicted without the option of a fine. The day is not far distant, it is to be hoped, when a similar law will be applied to the vaccinator and inoculator alike. Both are a violation of nature - the one a mere modification of the other. The inconsistency of punishing a parent for inoculating his child with a human disease and punishing him for not doing the same thing in a modified form, is an illustration of the blunders which Parliaments sometimes make when legislating on medical subjects, when, having given ear to a few doctrinaires, special- ists, and experts, are induced by such interested individuals and societies to make laws which bring Parliaments into derision. The long catalogue and immense pile of sanitary acts afford an instance of Parliamentary blundering, while the " Medical Acts," made in the interest of doctors and not for the protection of the people as professedly they were, afford another example of State medicine, of which vaccination is one department, the disgraceful " Contagious Diseases Acts " another.  To return to the doctrine that vaccination protects from smallpox.  * The College of Physicians in London adopted inoculation in the year 1754, and " considered it highly beneficial to man- kind."  12  the Theory oe protection a fallacy.  It is surprising, after the demonstrative evidence that has been afforded on the subject in the official reports of smallpox hospitals, that this dogma is still propounded by the medical faculty, and even re-vaccination urged upon the people at intervals of uncertain dates.  The frequent recurrence of smallpox epidemics in the metropolis where vaccination has been so extensively adopted - the increased severity and malignancy of the disease according to the hospital reports, lead us to inquire - What has vaccination done ?  That smallpox does not select its victims from the un- vaccinated portion of the population is evident from the fact that from 80 to 90 per cent, of the patients admitted into hospitals are found to have been vaccinated, and only 10 to 20 per cent, of the patients are unvaccinated. How comes it, then, that the great majority are the vaccinated, if the doctrine of protection be true ? It is passing strange, too, that if Mr. Simon's statement before the vaccination  Committee of 1871, that at least 95 per cent, of the population were well vaccinated, no fewer than 7,876 persons died of smallpox in one year (1871) in London alone.  It is no longer denied that the vaccinated do succumb to smallpox, but it is contended that a certain amount of protection is afforded. It is, moreover, assumed that those who recover from smallpox having been vaccinated, would probably have died had they not had some protection. The fact of the different degrees of natural susceptibility to  smallpox , as to scarlatina, measles, and all eruptive fevers, is ignored altogether.  That which was noted by one of the best English medical historians, Sir Gilbert Blane, is as truly applicable to existing  SIR GILBERT BLANE ON smallPOX.  13  populations as to those who lived 100 years ago. Speaking of smallpox he says : -  "To some individuals the variolous infection produces a " disease so malignant that nothing can stay its fatality, while " in others the disturbance is so slight as not to deserve the name " of a disease, so that there is every intermediate shade of " severity and mildness, of danger and safety, in the cases of " the individuals whom it affects. It is clearly ascertained that " there are constitutions entirely insusceptible of smallpox, " whether casual or inoculated, so that there is a series of " constitutions of every possible gradation from the insuscep- " tible through all stages of mildness and severity to those in " which it is irremediably fatal."  " The casual smallpox is sometimes as mild as the inocu- " lated, and the inoculated sometimes as mild as the casual."  These sentences were penned by Sir Gilbert Blane in the days when inoculation was practised. That " modifying " and "protective" operation failed, and was abandoned later on, for vaccination from the lower animals : this has also failed, and must sooner or later be abandoned for more rational hygienic means.  It is not necessary for me to enter upon a discussion of the various pleadings of those who advocate vaccination. The theory of absolute protection (not long since universally imposed on the credulous) is now universally given up.  "Protected for ever," were the words of Jenner when he went to Parliament seeking a reward for his so-called discovery, which was to stamp out smallpox in Europe in thirty years.  Protection is efficient by one vesicle only was the dogma held for two generations. That idea is abandoned, and now four to twelve vesicles are considered essential, protection being according to the number of marks ! ! !  14  smallPOX IN LONDON IN 1 87 7 .  It is stated that fewer of the vaccinated die of smallpox than the unvaccinated. My experience in thirty years of active practice has not led me to that conclusion, and in future pages the reader will find that among the deaths recorded by the Registrar-General as many or more vaccinated than unvaccinated die of smallpox.  I repeat here that which I stated to the Committee of the House of Commons in 1871 - that the evidence adduced to support the theory of protection is negative and unreliable.  Let me here quote from the weekly reports of the Registrar- General for the first thirteen weeks of the year 1877, which will suffice. The figures may be verified by reference to the Registrar-General's office.  The following tables show the number of smallpox deaths in London in each of the first 13 weeks of the years 1877 and 1881 - during the epidemics in London where they now recur every fourth year : -  Table I.

It tells us that of 562 deaths recorded in 13 weeks, 126 were vaccinated, that is, by their own showing, 22 per cent, of the whole number of deaths.  It tells us, secondly, that there were 240 z/zzvaccinated, which show a mortality of 45 per cent, of the deaths.  It tells us, thirdly, that 196 of the deaths were recorded as " not stated," carefully avoiding the words, " not known."  I have a perfect right to add these to the number recorded as vaccinated, seeing that 95 per cent, of the population are vaccinated. From what has been brought to light in reference to the returns of vaccinated and unvaccinated, there is great reason strongly to suspect that, to say the least, there is some error, if not wilful, yet probable, in the returns. Strange, indeed, that in nearly 200 cases out of 562 who died, there should be no evidence of vaccination in a population so extensively vaccinated as the English.  It must not be forgotten that it has been implied by Mr. Marson, in his evidence before the Committee of the House of Commons, 1871, that those cases of confluent smallpox in which the vaccine marks are obliterated, although vaccinated, are catalogued as jinvaccmated, because the cases are severe; and in reply to Questions No. 4,322 and 4,324, Mr. Marson said referring to a large number of cases which recovered from smallpox although no cicatrix was visible, he accepted the statement of the patients that they had been vaccinated.  " I assumed said he, " that they were protected to that extent , " or else they zuould have died at the same rate as the unvaccinated " died."  It will be seen in the following Table, No. III., that the epidemic in 1881 differed but slightly from the ten years) average, and on comparing it with that for 1877, it will appear that the epidemic of 18S1 is only half as severe as that  average of deaths from smallPOX, 1871-80 17  of 1877 - the deaths in the first 13 weeks in that year, being 1,192, and in 1881, 61S. No accurate comparison can be made between the two epidemics until the one now prevailing has run its course.  Table III.

IQ  Table IV. shows that in the first sixteen years of registration the number who died of smallpox in London, including four epidemics, was 16,531, giving a yearly average of 1,033. That was a period of vaccination endowed by the State since 1840.  If we take the 24 years since the passing of the Compulsory Act of 1853 we find smallpox has killed 26,208, giving a yearly average of 1,092. This included five epidemics.  The increased number of deaths from smallpox was thus found to be in a greater ratio than the increase of population.*  If we take the first ten years of registration, viz., 1838 to 1847, in which the great epidemic occurred extending over four years, we find the number died of smallpox was 11,462, giving a yearly average of 1,146.  Contrasting this with the ten years, r868 to 1877, a period when the Compulsory Vaccination Act of 1853 had been enforced by fine and imprisonment and nearly the whole population were vaccinated, we find an enormous increase in the mortality, no less than 17,175 having died in ten years, giving a yearly average of 1,717.  This presents to us a lamentable result of seventy years' trial of vaccination, and nearly a quarter of a century of compulsory vaccination.  Reference has been made to the Report to Parliament of the Epidemiological Society, on which legislation was erroneously founded. That report was an attempt to show that the mortality from smallpox had been greatly diminished by vaccination, and also that vaccinated countries on the continent presented most valuable proof of its advantages. This latter statement will be referred to in future pages.  v A similar result was shown in England and Wales in my Vital Statistics, No. I., addressed to the President of the Local Government Board.  20  smallPOX MORTALITY 1 650 TO 1850.  I proceed, therefore, first to analyse the statement of the Epidemiological Society in regard to London.  The following Table was produced to show that vaccination had reduced the mortality from smallpox, contrasting the first half of the present century with the two preceding centuries.  It must be understood that the number of deaths from smallpox was in reference to deaths from other causes, and not in reference to population or the number living. It is important to bear this in mind, as the proportion of deaths from one disease to 1000 deaths is no index of the general mortality prevailing at the time, and there is reason to believe that the whole mortality was little affected by the prevalence of either one or other of the seven epidemics then, any more than it has been in more recent times.

The reason assigned for excluding these twenty years is stated to be because " in those years inoculation and vaccination were both practised."  It happens, however, that in the decade ending 1810, when there was a mingling of the two inoculatory processes,  smallpox  and cowpox, the deaths were nearly double those in the decade ending 1670 and above the average of the half-century ending in 1700. The omission of the years in the two decades ending 1820 is to be regretted.  The most startling fact presented in the table is the increased mortality through the practice of inoculation introduced in the year 1822, and continued into the present century, when the cowpox was substituted for smallpox.  It will be seen in the following Table that by the insertion of the decade 1800 to 1810 the more gradual subsidence of smallpox is made apparent, the mortality in that decade being 64. Including those years in the following category, thus completing the first half of the present century, the rate was not 29 but 36 to a thousand deaths.

The following extracts from the work of Sir Gilbert Blane further show the increase of smallpox by inoculation. That renowned historian boldly asserts his conviction that the artificial production of smallpox by vaccination spread the disease all over England, introducing smallpox into localities which it had never previously visited.  SIR GILBERT BLANE ON INOCULATION.  Table VII. showing the mortality from smallpox to the total mortality, as recorded by Sir Gilbert Blane : -  Table VII.  i st Series from 1706 to 1720 78 in 1,000  2nd " from 1745 to 1759 89 ' n I >°°°  3rd " from 1783 to 1798 94 in 1,000  4th " from 1804 to 1818 53 in 1,000  The 1st series is for the 13 years immediately preceding the introduction of inoculation.  The 2nd is taken at the middle of the last century when inoculation had made considerable progress.  The 3rd comprises the 15 years previous to the introduction of vaccination, when inoculation had made still greater progress.  The 4th comprises the time in which the vaccine inoculation has been so far diffused as to produce a notable effect on the mortality of smallpox.  The foregoing Table, though not arranged in precisely the same dates as the two previous Tables, coincides generally with them as to results. The fact of the increased mortality by inoculation is manifest.  It is thus seen that at the close of the last, and the com- mencement of the present century, smallpox declined gradually in England.  That this was not the result of vaccination is clear, but arose from two distinct causes : Firstly, from the general subsidence of all febrile and malignant diseases ; and, secondly, by the gradual and general abandonment of inoculation.  The general subsidence of mortality from malignant fevers in the 18th century in England is admitted by all authors.*  * See my Essay on Vaccination. " Its tested effects on Health, Mortality, and Population." Bailliere : London and Paris.  24  DR. FARR ON THE DECLINE OF FEVERS.  Dr. Willan says: "The decrease from the year 1750 is to be " imputed partly to the increased system of cleanliness which " was then adopted, and partly to the diminution of the use of " spirituous liquors, in consequence of the ' Gin Act,' passed in " 1 7 5 3 -"  Dr. Farr prepared a Table showing the decline of fevers, smallpox, plague, dysentery, &c., in the Eighteenth century so remarkable in London. The Table furnished by Dr. Farr, (of the Registrar-General's Department), London, exhibits this, and also shows the increased mortality from smallpox by the practice of inoculation. Hence in the Years  1629-35 the smallpox mortality was 1660-79 " " "  I 7 2 ^- 57 (. under inoculation  1 77 1-80 j  1801-10 it fell lo  1831-35 " "  184O-54 !> "  ... l80  ... 417  U26 < 5° 2 ... 204  ... 83  ... 40  Towards the end of the last century, Dr. Heberden, said : -  " Inoculation, despite its advantages to individual life, was becoming a serious evil to Society. An admirable, and till then unrivalled, invention, it could only be worked at an intolerable cost of life."  " The historian of smallpox looking back on the labours which during twelve centuries had been made to mitigate its ravages comes to a mournful conclusion on their value. The confession that must be made is mortifying to a professional man, for it appears in spite of all medical exertion, the mortality of  smallpox  has progressively augmented.  " It has been made evident by calculations from the Bills of Mortality of the City of London, renowned for medical science,  DR. HEBERDEN ON INOCULATION.  25  that at the beginning of the eighteenth century about one- fourteenth of the inhabitants died of the smallpox, and during the last thirty years of that century, when the practice in  smallpox  was highly improved, the mortality of the disease was augmented to one-tenth. Thus the practice of inoculation made matters worse."  In 1801, the same author, in his work, entitled, "Observations on the Increase and Decrease of different Diseases," at page 36, says : -  " In London more persons have died of smallpox since the " introduction of inoculation. Out of every 1,000 deaths in the " Bills of Mortality attributed to smallpox during the first 30 "years of the 1 Sth century, before inoculation could have had " any effect upon them, they amounted to 74. During an " equal number of cases at the end of the century they "amounted to 95 in the 1,000, an increase of no less than 30 " per cent, by that interference by inoculation."  Let me now direct attention to the contrast between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in London. Overcrowding and want of cleanliness were the two principal causes in the development and spread of febrile and other diseases which carried off such large numbers in the 17th and 18th centuries.  Lord Macaulay, in his history, describes the filthy condition of the City of London. No soap, a very scanty supply of water ; the floors covered with rushes, only changed once or twice a year. No wonder that smallpox and plague were so malignant.  Overcrowding was the chief cause. The result is seen still in many of the purlieus of London, and the difference of mortality between the East and West-end is mainly owing to this cause, as in Liverpool and other large densely- populated cities.  26  FATALITY OF smallPOX IN CROWDED CITIES.  Had Parliament made an enactment limiting the number of persons to the acre, how much of the past and present mortality would have been prevented !  I find in my researches that in the year 1631 there was in the City of London a population of 130,178 inhabitants, packed closely together day and night within and without the walls ; the number of persons to the acre was 80, the area within the walls was 1,660 acres. In the year 1700 the population had increased to 208,300, being 126 persons to the acre. London grew and fortunately extended its suburbs over such an extent that although in the year 1841 the population had reached nearly two millions (1,948,369) the number of persons to the acre was only 25. In 1847 the area of London was still further extended. In 1851 the population had increased to 2,373,799, still avoiding overcrowding; but, alas! such is the rapidity with which London increases that in 1871 the population had risen to 3,254,260, in a space measuring 122 square miles, and even then the average number of persons to the acre was 42.

I submit that we should leave out of consideration altogether the statistics of the last and previous centuries, and take the experience of the present century - the advent of vaccination - especially as legislative measures have been enacted to enforce an experiment the result of which I undertake to demonstrate has been a failure.  Vaccination was purchased by Parliament for thirty thousand pounds of the public money early in the present century, endowed under the Act of 1840, which, while endowing vaccination, made inoculation a penal offence.  In 1853 vaccination was made compulsory, founded, as before stated, on a statement of the Epidemiological Society.  The experiment of inoculation, continued for a period of seventy years, proved an utter failure as regards mitigating smallpox.  * Diminished in the central district in which the City proper is included.  28  smallPOX DEATHS PER MILLION LIVING.  Full seventy years have now been expended in a similar inoculation mania in the name of vaccine. This also has proved a failure. The time will come when it, like inoculation, will be fnade a penal offence.  Table VIII.

PART II.- ENGLAND AND WALES.  In the foregoing pages I have endeavoured to place before the reader, a comprehensive statement of facts which stand as fixed historical truths, together with a brief exposition so necessary to the proper understanding of dry figures. I felt it to be necessary, in order to refute the arguments and statements made by the supporters of vaccination, to present such an array of facts as should establish the premises on which I take my stand - viz., that the subsidence of smallpox at the commencement of the present century which had gradually taken place before inoculation was introduced (see Table V.), was not due to vaccination as was inferred by the Epidemiological Society from the returns furnished from foreign countries.  That fatal error led the Legislature, prompted by some half- dozen interested individuals composing the Epidemiological Society, blindly to enact a stringent law of compulsion,* although for 23 years vaccination had been endowed by the State, the poor-rate being charged with all the fees and expenses connected with vaccination. Gratuitous vaccination was provided for all who presented themselves for the  See in Appendix brief history of Vaccination Acts.  3 °  VITAL STATISTICS OF THREE EPIDEMICS.  operation* to the Public Vaccinator, who was a properly qualified medical man.  Having disposed of the first portion of this essay referring to London, I now proceed to give some information concerning England and Wales, noting the provincial cities and towns.  In Vital Statistics, No. I., I gave the number of deaths from smallpox, erysipelas and syphilis for 25 years, including also the number of deaths from all causes; the births and also the number of vaccinations in proportion to births.  The following extract was so startling that even the faculty, to a considerable extent, confessed their surprise at the unexpected result. The few figures which were the undeniable expression of facts demonstrated that, as vaccinations increased, smallpox deaths multiplied. It disappointed those who anticipated a diminution of deaths as vaccinations were multiplied. Those seventy thousand deaths, it should be borne in mind, were not selected from the unvaccinated portion of the population.  Vaccination was made compulsory by an Act of Parliament in the year 1853 ; again in 1867, and still more stringent in 1871. Since 1853, we have had three epidemics of smallpox.  ¦pv Deaths from Small -pox in  England and Wales.  1st Epidemic - 1 85 7-5 S-59 ... 14,244  2nd " - 1863-64-65 ... 20,059  3rd " -1870-71-72 ... 44,840  * Inoculation with smallpox and cowpox was done by means of a darning-needle by thousands of old women, and done effectually. To-day I find in the Ninth Annual Report of the Local Government Board that no vaccinator can legally act as such unless he has- the double qualification of surgeon and physician ! ! !

Increase of population from 2nd to 3rd epidemic ... 10 per cent. Increase of smallpox in the same period... ... 120 per cent.  In the year 1857, Mr. Simon, in his " Papers on Vaccination," before referred to, said : -  " In large part, vaccination is certainly good, otherwise small " pox could not, within half a century, as it has been, rendered " comparatively infrequent and i nocuous."  The Tables in my letter to Mr. Sclater-Booth, demonstrated the fallacy of this remark. A study of those tables will show the increased mortality from smallpox, and that in an increasing ratio, as seen in the above extract. So far from the disease having been rendered comparatively infrequent and inocuous, there died in London alone, in the year 1871, no fewer than seven thousand, nine hundred and twelve persons, showing a death-rate of no less than 2,430 per million living.  Mr. Simon stated that the death rate of smallpox had been reduced by vaccination to 158 per million.  The following extracts from the official returns show what a frightful mortality occurred in some of the principal towns in England (see Tables IX. and X.) The Table IX. might be extended, however, and the death rate of all the towns given, the few selected show what ravages smallpox made in a vaccinated population. Where the vaccination laws have been forced with severity, the mortality exceeded even that in the metropolis : -  Table IX.  DEATHS FROM smallPOX PER MILLION IN THE YEAR 1871.

In the next Table it will be perceived that those districts in which there is the greatest number of populous towns, the mortality is highest. Of these the Northern district, No. 10, stands at the head both in 1871 and 1872, and far higher than London. The North-Western district also presents a heavy  mortality.  D  34 smallPOX DEATHS IN ELEVEN DIVISIONS 187 1.  As the population of each district is given in the first column, and the actual number of deaths in the second column, the third column, showing the death-rate per million living may be tested.  Were it desirable to ascertain the proportion of deaths from smallpox to each thousand deaths from all causes, according to the plan adopted by the Epidemiological Society, in their report referred to at the commencement of this essay, I could add the necessary figures, but the fallacy of the deductions from such a basis is so misleading, that I omit them purposely to avoid burdening the facts with useless means of comparison. In a future portion of the work this will be demonstrated.  Table XI.

It will be noticed that the death-rate was one-thousand and twenty- four per million living in 1871 in England and Wales. In the metropolis it reached the enormous rate of two-thousand four-hundred and thirty per million living.  The following Table XIV. is extracted from the Blue Book, (Report of Committee 1871), furnished to the Committee at the suggestion of Mr. John Simon, Medical Officer of the Local Government Board.  It is important shewing that, which I had stated, and to which Mr. Simon took exception, that in the five years, 1838-42, which included the most severe epidemic of smallpox in the present century, the deaths from all causes were 700 fewer when the smallpox killed 571 per million of the inhabitants than in the five years, 1865-69, when smallpox killed only 145 per million. It is to be noted also that the deaths of children per million living under five years of age were nearly four thousand fewer when smallpox carried off so many as 5 7 1 per million, against 145 per million.  37  MEAN ANNUAL DEATH-RATE smallPOX 1839 TO 1879   smallPOX -MORTALITY INCREASED.  Since the forgoing Table was prepared with the avowed object of refuting my evidence before the Committee, in reference to the fact that the prevalence of smallpox does not increase but diminishes the general mortality, I have obtained additional returns, extracted at the office of the Registrar- General, by the courtesy of Dr. Ogle, who has succeeded Dr. Farr in the department. The additional two columns are seen on the right hand in Table XIV.  It will be seen from the above added figures that the death-rate of smallpoxjias greatly increased, being heavier than all the averages since the great epidemic, 1838-42.

Reference has been made to the evidence given by Mr. Simon, Medical Officer of the Privy Council and the Local Government Board, in respect to the complete vaccination of the people. Mr. Simon stated that in 1853 the people must have been fairly vaccinated , as the mortality was so small.  In 1881 we are told that the prevalence and fatality of smallpox leads to the inference that there must be a great amount of bad vaccination. It is no longer contended that there is a lack of duty on the part of the vaccinator, as it cannot be denied that the masses of the people who get  NUMBER VACCINATIONS TO BIRTHS.  41  smallpox are vaccinated.

Having in the foregoing chapters disposed of England and Wales, including the metropolis of England, I now proceed to direct attention to the condition which Scotland presented, when the epidemic of smallpox reached that country in 1871.  Witnesses who gave evidence before the Select Committee on the Vaccination Acts in 1871, stated that so perfect was vaccination in Scotland that smallpox was stamped out. In the year 1866 only 200 died  In 1867 ... 100  " 1868 ... 15  " 1869 ... 64  "See what vaccination has done," said Dr. Wood.  In giving evidence before that Committee, I was asked the following Question, No. 1,239. - " I s it your idea that in " spite of the 95 per cent, who are vaccinated in Scotland, the "epidemic will still extend there?"  My reply was : " Yes ; Acts of Parliament will not keep away " epidemics."  To Question No. 1,238, I replied : " I did not expect the " epidemic in Scotland until next year, but I now think it is " due this year. I predicted 1870 in England, and it came " in due course, and is now among us."  I also warned the Committee that smallpox would not spare the vaccinated. What happened? The epidemic did reach  44  DR. WOOD'S EVIDENCE FALLACIOUS.  Scotland in 1871, and the smallpox deaths which in 1870 were 1 14, now rose to 1,442, and in the year 1872 no less than 2,488.  Dr. Wood, of Edinburgh, gave evidence before that Com- mittee. Dr. Wood is a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and has been its President. He is also a Member of the General Council of Medical Education, under the Medical Act of 1858.  In 1863, the Scotch Compulsory Vaccination Act was " passed. To Question 4,366, Dr. Wood replied : " Since the " Compulsory Vaccination Act, there is a decided diminution " of smallpox ; in fact, we have had no epidemic of smallpox "in Scotland since the passing of the Vaccination Act on the " 28th of July, 1863 (eight years ago)."  In reply to Question 4,389, Dr. Wood says : " The operation " of the Act of 1863 has very largely diminished the amount of " epidemic smallpox. Both the Registrar-General in his reports, " and the Board of Supervision have testified to the extreme " value of the Scotch Act."  To Question 4,390, he replied : "There is no reason to believe " that the protection afforded by vaccination has diminished, or " the least occasion for any fear that it will ever regain its " former power."  To Question 4,471, he said: "The amount of smallpox " mortality in Scotland in the last few years, has very markedly " diminished as the result , I believe, of a more perfect system " of vaccination, resulting from putting into operation of the "Act of 1863."  Dr. Wood is one of those zealots who, like Dr. Corrisan, of Dublin, whose opinion can no more be moved by facts than the Great Pyramid.  DR. LYON PLAYFAIR'S OPINION FALSIFIED. 45  To Question 4,497, he made use of an extraordinary phrase : " I do not think," he said, " that a person has a right to keep "an unvaccinated child any more than a fierce dog ."  This exceeds in absurdity, the folly displayed by Sir Dominic Corrigan, M.D., who compared an unvaccinated child to a bag of gunpowder.  The Third Annual Report of the Registrar-General of Scotland says: "Never since Civil Registration began in " Scotland, has smallpox been so rare as during the past three "years, when the Vaccination Act was in full operation."  Dr. Playfair, Professor of Chemistry, a Scotchman, said in the House of Commons, July 6, 1870 : "There could not be " the slightest doubt that compulsory laws when properly "applied as in Scotland and Ireland ! I were perfectly equal to " stamp out smallpox in a country."  We shall presently see what the opinions of those scientific men and doctors are worth.  Let us leave opinions and go to facts.  Table XIX. exhibits the yearly deaths from smallpox in Scotland, from 1855 to 1872. It will be seen that the boasted stamping out under the Compulsory Act of 1863, was not true.  How prone are the vaccinators to cry out in the absence of an epidemic, when the mortality is low, " See what vaccination " has done /"  In the epidemic of 1871-2, three-thousand, nine-hundred and thirty were carried off.

Pitt Dundas, the Registrar-General, Scotland, thus writes, addressed to the Right Hon. R. Assheton Cross, M.P. :  " August 7, 1876.  "The Vaccination Act continues to work very efficiently in " Scotland. Those entrusted with its administration do not " find their efforts for the public good thwarted by any unpopular "prejudice. On the contrary, the people seem to have an " intelligent appreciation of the benefits which the practice of " vaccination secures for tlieniP  I have thus demonstrated the utter inutility of vaccination against smallpox when an epidemic visits a country or city. When there is no epidemic, the people are lulled into a feeling of false security by a wanton unnatural operation, while neglecting their duties in regard to sanitary matters.  Surely the age of false prophets has not yet passed away !  So much for well-vaccinated Scotland.  PART IV.- IRELAND.  I now come to the Sister Isle, and there, also, the same untoward results as those just related of Scotland are presented.  Ireland has been often quoted as an instance of the success of vaccination, by " authorities." Heaven save the mark! " Authorities ?" The ignorance displayed by some of the members of the Committee of 1871, as well as the witnesses, would be sufficient, on any other subject, to brand them as " blind leaders of the blind."  Let me recall some few examples by quotations from the Minutes of Evidence, and compare the opinions of the advocates with the stern facts which I now educe.  It was only natural that I should be first asked respecting my opinions, knowing as the Committee did, that I am against vaccination altogether. In my examination by that Committee, the following question was put to me (on the 10th of March).  Question 1,141. - "Then if I understand you rightly, the statement that I have often seen of late that Ireland is free from smallpox, because it is more completely vaccinated than England, is not a true statement?"  Answer. - " It is not founded on fact."  [In answer to previous questions I had furnished the official statistics.]  Question 1,143. - "Can you tell me, then, how it is that vaccination should be thought to prevent smallpox in Ireland,  E  IRELAND CONTINUED.  So  and yet that in spite of vaccination, we have an epidemic in this country at this time ?'"  Answer . - " Simply from an absence of the epidemic. In all probability, following the epidemic wave which is now passing over Europe, Ireland next year, or even this year, will present a very heavy mortality from smallpox."  On the 28th of April, 1871, Sir Dominic Corrigan, M.D., was examined by the Committee, with the following result Question 4,002. - " Do you take it that the great freedom from smallpox and from deaths, from that disease in Ireland, is at all owing to the way in which vaccination has been carried out in that country ? "  Answer. - " I think the true state is, that vaccination has been carried out very well, and that the people are most  favourably disposed towards it The feeling of  the whole country is in favour of it."  Dr. Corrigan was one of the members of the Committee selected by Mr. W. E. Forster. Dr. Brewer and Dr. Lyon Playfair were also members of that Committee.  As usual the absence of smallpox was attributed to  vaccination tion having been so superior in Ireland, and the people so obedient, that, in the opinion of Sir Dominic Corrigan, M.D., no compulsory action was needed by his countrymen (see Questions 4,002 to 4,008 in evidence.)  It does seem monstrous that notwithstanding the abundance of evidence of the failure of vaccination, its advocates still persisted in demanding a more stringent Act of Parliament to enforce it. A bill has since passed into law.  Since the epidemic belied those opinions, a pamphlet, entitled, " On the Prevalence oe smallpox in Dublin, by Thomas W. Grimshaw, M.A., M.D., has been published, the substance of which pamphlet appeared in the Dublin Journal of Medical Science, June, 1878.  I  IRELAND CONTINUED. 5 I  Dr. Grimshaw's reason for bringing his papers under the notice of the Medical Society of the College of Physicians, "was to show in a most conclusive manner the great benefits " which vaccination has conferred on the community."  In Table I., given by Dr. Grimshaw, the average annual number of deaths from smallpox in Ireland in the decade, 1851-61, was 1,273 ; and in the decade, 1861-71, was 411.  The Compulsory Vaccination Act, and the Act for the Registration of Births and Deaths in Ireland, both came into force on the 1st of January, 1 864. Prior to that date there were no reliable statistics. "During the last decade, 1861-71-, " the most important change took place in the vacci- " nation laws. The result of the enforcement of this Act is " remarkable, for during the decade the mortality from  smallpox  fell from 1,273 to 41 1."  Dr. Grimshaw says : " These statistics show that the deaths from smallpox have decreased in the decade, 1861-71, and are accounted for in a most satisfactory manner by the progress of vaccination. He attempts to make the public believe not only that vaccination diminishes the mortality, but that it prevents the recurrence of epidemics.  It is lamentable that the advocates of vaccination should be guilty, as they are, of suppressing facts in order to sustain their theory by patented statements.  When Dr. Grimshaw published his paper, he must have been n possession of the official statistics published in the annual report of the Local Government Board for Ireland, published in 1874, and which includes the mortality from 1864 to 1873.  52  DR. CR1MSHAW REFUTED.  Indeed, at page 6 of his pamphlet, he gives the number of deaths from smallpox in Ireland, in each year, from 1864 to 1877, comprising a period of fourteen years, thus : -  Table XXIII.  Year.  Deaths from smallpox.  Year.  Deaths from Small -pox.  1864  854  1871  665  1865  461  1872  3248  1866  194  1873  5°4  1867  2 1  1S74  569  i 868  23  is 75  539  1869  20  1876  21  1S70  32  1877  61  Here we have facts furnished under the Registration Act, of 1863, and it is notable how disappointing must be the truth when it comes out.  Dr. Grimshaw makes his decade end, as given above, in 1871. Why he excluded the following six years can only be interpreted by inferring that the including of those years of increased mortality would have shown the fallacy of his assertions.  Let us take these fourteen years and divide them into two equal periods : -  In the first seven years, (  1864 to 1870 ... ... '(  In the second septenniad ... (  1871 to 1877 ... ... '(  Dr. Grimshaw tells the Medical Society that "in 1S64 a "serious epidemic of smallpox (causing S54 deaths) prevailed, " which had commenced in the previous year. The enforce- " ment of the new Act, and the panic caused by the epidemic, had  smallpox deaths. 1,605  5,607  VACCINATIONS AND BIRTHS.  S 3  "stimulated vaccination to such an extent that 191,810 persons " were vaccinated by the Dispensary Medical Officers during " the year ending September, 1864. The number of  vaccination " t ions exceeding considerably the number of births registered. The "result of this activity in vaccination was a diminished " prevalence of smallpox, the deaths from this disease fallingto "461 in 1S65, and further falling the next year when the " epidemic ceased."  Here we have a reiteration of the old, oft-told story - "See what vaccination has done " ! ! When the epidemic, in this instance, as in every other, had subsided by a natural law, i.c., when it had prevailed for about two years it died out*, and immediately the vaccinators exultingly exclaimed, "See what we have done ! ! We have stamped out the epidemic" ! !  Now let us look for a moment at the relation existing between the number of vaccinations and the number who died of smallpox : -  Table XXIV.  Year.  Persons  Vaccinated.  Died of smallpox.  Years.  Persons  Vaccinated.  Died of smallpox.  1864  191810  854  1871  179889  665  1865  169142  461  1872  282484  3248  i860  I 37 I2 4  194  1873  13S873  504  1867  I2 574 I  21  1874  139587  569  1868  i 3 r 4 2 6  23  1875  137340  535  1869  125672  20  1876  114487  21  1870  140220  3 2  1877  ...  61  Sir Dominic Corrigan was probably stating the truth when in 1871 he told the Committee of the House of Commons on the Vaccination Acts, that " the people of Ireland are most  * Note. - The epidemic broke out in the autumn of 1871, and left in the summer of 1873.  54  smallPOX IX DUBLIN.  favourably disposed to vaccination," for we find in the fore- going Table, that in that year, 1871, the number of births in Ireland was 151,665, while in the same year, 180,000 were vaccinated. More astounding still in the year 1872 - 149,292 were born, and 282,484 were vaccinated.  Thus we have here a further confirmation of what I have repeatedly observed, recorded, and published, that the same result as that which followed inoculation in the last century, is now occurring as the consequence of vaccination, viz., the more vaccinations, the more smallpox. A careful inspection of the foregoing Table should convince the most sceptical of that fact.  The Local Government Board for Ireland, in their Report to the Lord Lieutenant, dated March 31, 1874, thus remarks on the considerable increase of vaccinations : -  " The exceptionally large number of vaccinations, the result "of alarm in 1872 (282,484), consisted to a very considerable " amount, of vaccinations and re-vaccinations of adults. Such " vaccinations in 1872 exceeded those of the same class in 1871 " by 98,986 cases, and exceeded those of 1S73 by 120,268. The " increase between the two former , and decrease between the two " latter years coinciding with the rise and subsidence of  " THE smallPOX."  So much for Ireland. I will conclude this chapter by referring briefly to the City of Dublin, and here we have the usual phenomenon presented to us - that smallpox was "stamped out" by vaccination - a proof of which was, it was boasted, evident by the fact that in the year 1S67 there were only two deaths from smallpox. In 1868, one death only. In 1869, one death. In 1870, not a single death from smallpox was registered. " Stamped out." The cry was uttered not only by Sir Dominic Corrigan, but by Dr. Lyon Playfair, by  smallPOX IN DUBLIN.  55  Dr. Brewer, by Air. W. E. Forster: by, indeed, many members of that Commitee, to all of whom I said when the " fact " was thrown in my face, " Wait till the epidemic visits Ireland, and then you will see that the smallpox will pay no respect to the vaccinated." Before that year expired 207 died of smallpox in Dublin alone. In the following year (1872) no less than ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIED. Two  thousand five hundred cases were admitted into the hospital alone.  Below s the mortality as registered from 1864 to 1877 : -  Table XXV.  Year.  Died  of  Smallpox.  Year.

Dublin is now blessed by a second epidemic since 1871, when smallpOx was said to be " extinct."  I cannot conclude my observations on Ireland, without adding a quotation from the Report of Dr. Seaton on the late epidemic of smallpox in the United Kingdom, contained in the  smallPOX IX CORK.  56  Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council to the Local Government Board, 1874. Dr. Seaton says: -  " In the year 1872 the disease was diffused more or less over "the whole of Ireland, with the exception of the province of " Connaught. The chief mortality was in the cities of Dublin "and Cork. The deaths in Dublin in 1872 were 1,350, and "throughout the whole of the epidemic, 1,557, or the rate of five thousand per million of the population.  "The deaths in Cork were 1,873, or at the rate of nine " thousand, six hundred per million living, which is a higher rate " than that of any large town in England."  It is lamentable that with all the foregoing facts before them, Members of Parliament should favour by their assent the enactment of a still more stringent law for enforcing  vaccination tion on the people of Ireland. Still more is it to be deplored that Her Majesty's Government, by lending an ear to the interested promoters of such Acts, should favour the extension of a despotism which will, sooner or later, endanger the peace of the Nation, the credit of the Profession, and jeopardise, it may be, the lives of Public Vaccinators, and Inspectors of Vaccination.  The foregoing afford ample evidence from authorities which cannot be called in question - first, that smallpox has increased in fatality as vaccination has been extended ; secondly, that the prediction that vaccination would stamp out smallpox is not fulfilled ; and thirdly, that the periodic visitations of smallpox, like other epidemics, follow a natural law over which neither vaccination nor legislation has any control.  These conclusions will be further strengthened in the remaining portions of this Essay by reference to many of the European States ; notably Sweden, Denmark, and Germany, all and other "well-vaccinated countries,"  PART V. - SWEDEN.  The laws by which vaccination is enforced in Sweden are thus recorded : -  " I. - Every child must be vaccinated before it is two years  old.  "II. - A certain period after vaccination is fixed for ascer- taining the results of the operation. Presentation for inspec- tion is likewise obligatory.  "III. - Anyone found guilty of contravening the provisions of the law is punished with fines of from one and a half to five crowns. (During an actual epidemic, of not less than five crowns), and in default of payment, with imprisonment.  " IV. - Every vaccinated person is bound, under a penalty of five crowns to allow matter to be taken from him should it be required by the vaccinator.  " V. - No one can be admitted into a public school, or other educational institution, without a certificate of having been vaccinated, or of having had the natural smallpox ; or that having been vaccinated five years previously, at the longest no results were obtained.  "VI. - Indigent children are vaccinated at the expense of the Commune,  5 8  MR. SIMON ON SWEDEN.  "VII. - The Communal Authorities are entrusted with carrying out the law, but may, in case of urgency, call in the aid of the Crown officials.  " When smallpox is epidemic, vaccination ought to take place in the first month of life.  " Re-vaccination is generally recommended at the age of 15, and is prescribed for recruits for the army and navy."  Such is the law in Sweden.  I now desire to call attention to those foreign countries referred to by Mr. Simon, and other witnesses, in which vacci- nation has been more or less compulsory for the past sixty years. Mr. Simon's " Papers on Vaccination," presented to Parliament in 1857, were reproduced and presented again to the Committee of 1871.  Why Mr. Simon contented himself with laying before the Committee of 1871 information twenty years' old, appears remarkable, with all the facilities at his command in his Department, for obtaining the more recent facts so much needed by the Committee.  The countries especially referred to were Sweden, Denmark, and Prussia, as the most and best vaccinated countries - countries in which smallpox was " stamped out " by vaccination. To those countries I therefore particularly direct attention, as illustrating the fact that, with the most extensive vaccination, the mortality from smallpox, as in England, has so greatly' increased that, in some instances, it has exceeded that of the last century.  Among the Papers alluded to, we find the annexed Table (No. XXVI), showing the number of deaths from smallpox since the introduction of vaccination. In his commentary' on the statistics he stated that vaccination had reduced the death rate to 158 per million during the forty years of vaccination.  smallPOX DEATHS IN SWEDEN. 59  Had the witness carried on his figures beyond the dates he quoted, he would have found a considerable increase.  My readers will find, further on, the list of mortality carried down to 1875.  Table XXVI.  SWEDEN.  DEATHS from smallpox in Sweden, 1821 to 1855  Years.  Deaths.  Years.

(That and the following year being non-epidemic years.) In the year 1857, however, an epidemic  * Mr. Simon's selected years, "proving" the successful results of compulsory vaccination.  6o  HEAVY MORTALITY IN' SWEDEN'  began, which prevailed until the middle of the year i860. In that epidemic, in a period of three years' prevalence, there died of smallpox in Sweden no fewer than four thousand persons.  Further, the same Table shows that in the five years ending 1869, there died of smallpox, 6,817, showing a yearly average of 1,363. Coming down to more recent years, the epidemic of 1873-4-5, we find in three years only, there died of smallpox more than seven thousand persons, giving a death- rate of one thousand six hundred and fifty-eight per million - all vaccinated, no doubt, under a compulsory law.  In Table XXVII., I have given in decades of years, from 1771 to 1870, the number of deaths from smallpox, ditto from all causes, with the death-rate per million living in each decade. Also for the five years ending 1875.  I have also added, separately, the three years included in the fatal epidemic which followed that, which was so severe in this country.  It will be observed that the estimated average population in each decade is given in one column of the Table.  In the decade, 1771-80, the deaths from smallpox to 1,000 deaths were 91.  In the following decade, 1781-90, it was 77, although the number of deaths from all causes was greater.  A remarkable instance of the fallacy of the statistics put forth in favour of vaccination is seen in the following.  In the decade, 1831-40, the deaths of smallpox to ever)' 1,000 deaths from all causes, was 1276, when there were 876 deaths from smallpox; while in the decades, 1851-60 and 1861-70, when the mortality from smallpox was nearly the same, deaths to all causes were only 1*9, and 1*5 per 1,000. This arose from the circumstance that the general  CONTINUED.  ( I  mortality was increased by dysentery which carried off 12,730 persons in 1S57, and by cholera, which killed 4,706 persons in the year 1866.  I am indebted to Dr. Berg, of Stockholm, to whom Dr. Farr kindly introduced me, for the official figures, excepting the death-rate per million, which has been carefully calculated for me by a London actuary. I have since come into possession of the Census Table, supplied by A. J. Siljestrom, which is to be found in Table XXVIII.  The increase of the death-rate from smallpox under com- pulsory vaccination in that country is startling and unexpected. Thus Mr. Simon's 11 per million in 1S55, have mounted to 355 per million in the quinquennial period, 1871-5, and during the epidemic of the three years, 1873-4-5, to no less than 1658 per million.  These results, are not theoretical speculations of pre- judiced advocates, but actual facts on the authority of the Government of Sweden, and cannot be lightly treated. They reveal a condition of things which, whatever may be adduced to the contrary, show the utter failure of vaccination.  62  SWEDEN CONTINUED.  Table XXVII.  SWEDEN.

IV. - That when vaccination was extended and enforced by Royal decree, in the year 1816, there followed a gradual revival of smallpox mortality.  T754 was the year when the College of Physicians is London commended strongly, the practice.   SWEDEN' CONTINUED.  V. - That the mortality in the late epidemic far exceeded many of those which preceded the general adoption of vaccination.  VI. - That Sweden affords a fair example of the utter inefficiency of vaccination to fulfil its professed power to "stamp out" the disease, seeing that for sixty years  vaccination tion has been compulsory, and re-vaccination extensively practised in that country.  The following extracts are made from the "Blue Book" Report of the Committee of the House of Commons, i S7 r, to show the generally prevailing belief among not only the well-paid officials of the Vaccination Department, but also of those medical men whose opinions, borrowed from officials, and not founded on reason or fact, were sought by a Committee, of the most part prejudiced Members, the Chairman of which (Mr. W. E. Forster), having stated in the House of Commons, when he applied for the Committee of Inquiry, did so not because he had any doubt of the benefits of vaccination, but because the inquiry would confirm the generally accepted belief in its value.  The following Table, No. XXIX., gives the death-rate of smallpox to one million living in each year, from 1771 to 1855, and exhibits the fluctuations in the number of deaths. The remarkable decline of smallpox is appa- rent in Sweden as in England in the latter part of the last century, and the beginning of the present. This decline of the disease being coincidental with the introduction of vaccination, unfortunately led to the fatal errror that the change was due to vaccination, although vaccination had not then been practised in Sweden.

Table XXX. shows that prior to vaccination, there was a gradual subsidence of smallpox mortality down to the year 1820, and that a revival of smallpox mortality has taken place, notwithstanding the strenuous efforts made since that date to check it by vaccination and re-vaccination, so that the mortality in the recent epidemic was the heaviest in the present century, the epidemic carrying off no less than seven thousand two hundred persons in a little more than two years, being 1658 per million living.

Dr. Gull, now Sir William Gull, in answer to Question No. 4,787, stated that Sweden, Norway, and Denmark were said to be the best vaccinated countries,  Dr. Seaton, Chief Director of the Vaccination Department of the Local Government Board, to the Question No. 5,601, " Which country would you consider most protected ? " " replied thus : - " I believe that Sweden, Denmark, and "Norway are very well protected."  68 OPINIONS OF THE 'HEADS' OF THE PROFESSION.  Mr. Marson, Surgeon to the London smallpox Hospital, Highgate, gave the following replies. To Question 4,122, he said : -  " The Swedes and Norwegians, who are the best vaccinators, "have seven good marks."  To Question 4,331 - "Did you recommend that similar " arrangements to those now in force in Sweden and Denmark "should be added here?"  " I did. I was very desirous of it, because I knew that the " people there were well vaccinated, almost invariably with " seven good marks, about the size of a fourpenny piece, and " the result is that they have smallpox very light."  [Yet they got into the London Hospital as smallpox patients.]  That well vaccinated country - Sweden - presents to the world a mortality from smallpox unparalleled in the present century.  It is manifest, then, that the supposed immunity from  smallpox  in well vaccinated countries is not due to vaccination, as when an epidemic occurs of more than ordinary severity, vaccination and re-vaccination, so extensively carried out in Sweden, are utterly powerless to protect populations.  The fallacy of the conclusion arrived at by the Epidemio- logical Society referred to by Mr. Simon, is thus clearly- demonstrated. Other causes, therefore, must exist quite independent of vaccination for the apparent immunity of Sweden during the years referred to by Mr. Simon.  I need not detain you longer on the country of Sweden. I have adduced abundant evidence of the unreliableness of the statements of the chief officials of the Local Government Board. Not only so, but the lamentable revelation now made of the utter ignorance of the " Heads " of the profession, manifested in the presence of the Committee of 1S71, I have  SWEDEN CONCLUDED.  69  quoted only a few of the wild sayings of those men who, unfortunately, are looked to as "the lights" of the Government.

Let me now refer to Stockholm, the Capital of Sweden.  Mr. Simon, in his Report to the Local Government Board, 1875, thus writes at page 61 : -  " In December, 1873, there set in at Stockholm an epidemic, "the deaths from smallpox amounted to 618 from December "in that year, to April, 1874, at which time the epidemic was " described as still 7 -aging. The population of Stockholm is "but 143,735,* so that evidently its smallpox death-rate will * This is incorrect (see Table XXXI. in this Essay). In 1854 it was 150,446.  " for this year, be considerably in excess of that of London, " or even of that of Liverpool in 1871."  I am indebted to Dr. Berg, Head of the Statistical Department of Stockholm, for the following official record of the deaths from smallpox in Stockholm in the late epidemic (together with four other Zymotic diseases).  Stockholm.  1873-  From Scarlatina  ... 126  " Hooping Cough...  ... no  " Typhus and Typhoid ...  264  " Diarrhoea  ... 722  " smallpox  191  1874.

HEAVY MORTALITY IN STOCKHOLM.  73  Making a total of 1,699. The population of Stockholm in the year 1874 was 150,000, which shows a death-rate of nearly eight thousand, per million living, whilst the death-rate in London in 1871 was 2,430 per million. Hence we have in the Capital of Sweden, " the best and most vaccinated country in Europe," a mortality nearly four times heavier than in London - a mortality as will be seen on reference to Tables herein, was greater than in any year of the present century.  All that has been said in regard to the country of Sweden applies with greater force to its Capital, Stockholm.  The death-rate in cities is everywhere heavier than in country populations, but the enormous mortality in Stockholm, the capital of that "7 veil vaccinated country," must have astounded the Simons and the Seatons, who at all times, and in all places constantly directed attention to Sweden, Denmark and Prussia, as being well-vaccinated countries, and where  smallpox  had been well nigh "stamped out."  The fatality of the epidemic to which attention is here directed, has falsified all their theories, and proved to demonstration that well vaccinated countries enjoy no greater immunity than England.  The Tables which are presented to the reader have been faithfully brought together from information directly furnished to me by Dr. Berg, the head of the Statistical Central Bureau, of Stockholm.  74  STOCKHOLM CONTINUED.

Here is presented a whole century of reliable statistics for which Sweden has been long famous, while in England we have no reliable statistics dating farther back than 1838. This is a misfortune, inasmuch as those who contend that the mortality from smallpox in former times was so  FLUCTUATION IN MORTALITY. 75  dreadful in contrast with that of the present century, make statements which can only be regarded as conjectural.  So far back as 1776 and 1777 the mortality was insignificant.  Again, in the three years, 1780-1-2, there died only 49 persons in the City. With the exception of an epidemic, about every fourth year as in London, the mortality was very moderate. The gradual decline in the mortality before the people were vaccinated is as marked in Stockholm City as in London, concurrent with the general decline of all forms of severe febrile and eruptive diseases, as civilization advanced, when cleanly habits and better habitations took the place of the filthy condition of past centuries.  I have constructed Table XXXV. with the object of distin- guishing the difference in mortality between epidemic and non- epidemic years. The regular manner in which the exanthe- matous diseases become epidemic, their settling down into quiescence, almost abandoning a locality for a time, is observable in all countries. The explanation is not easy. These remittent visitations appear to be governed by an unknown cause over which we have no control.  It is passing strange that the advocates of vaccination invariably take credit to themselves for their activity on the subsidence of smallpox, and childishly cry out, " See what we have done." Yet these men are the " Scientific Authorities " to whom, alas ! Parliament and the people listen. What has vaccination done for Stockholm?  76  STOCKHOLM MORTALITY.  Table XXXV.

The heaviest mortality in the whole century was that of iS72-3-and-4, after 60 years of vaccination.  FAILURE OF PREDICTIONS.  77  Table XXXVI. is the most remarkable, showing how the smallpox dropped in the first year of the present century, before vaccination ; how the mortality from nearly two thousand in the decade ending in the year 1800, fell to two hundred in the following ten years ; also how it fell to an average of four deaths in a year in the decade ending 1820. "See what vaccination has done," said Mr. Simon, pointing to those years.  Steadily, however, did smallpox advance under universal vaccination, each decennium presenting figures which ought to have convinced the authorities that this meddling vaccinating practice increased the severity of the disease with which they were doing battle. smallpox laughs in derision at this quackery. Look at the records, each ten years' product- heavier than the preceding - 41, 115, 339, 279,557, 685, 1810; while at length when everybody had been vaccinated and re-vaccinated in half a decade, the five years, 8171-2-3-4-5, the mortality went up to no less than fifteen hundred and fifty eight, the largest mortality for a century.  78  DEATH-RATE 7,916 PER MILLION.

How long in the face of the foregoing facts will this meddling and muddling be permitted by thinking peoples ? When will the nations put away this crime from before their eyes? How long shall this Golden Heifer be kept before nations by its devotees ?  Table XXXVII. has been furnished by Rektor Siljestrom and by Dr. Berg, and presents the records from official statistics of more than a century for the whole country.  Nothing can be clearer than the fact that the decline of mortality from smallpox towards the close of the last century was wholly independent of vaccination. Stockholm City is included in the Table.  So  CONTINUED.  For the death-rate per million living, the reader is referred to Table XXVII.  A diagram has been kindly furnished by Rektor P. A. Siljes- trom, and published by the Society for the Abolition of Compul- sory Vaccination, which completely confirms the law of vicarious mortality which I brought before the notice of the Committee of the House of Commons in 1871. The rise and fall of smallpox mortality, as well as the interchange I have endeavoured to elucidate in the chapter on " Vicarious Mortality," in this Essay, is seen at a glance in that diagram and the notes accompanying it.  It is there manifest, that when smallpox mortality declines, the general mortality increases, as stated in my evidence in 1871, and embodied in this Essay.  Reference to the Chapter on Vicarious Mortality in this Essay will completely demonstrate the law of interchange between Zymotic diseases.  SWEDISH STATISTICS CONTINUED.

NORWAY.  I append the following note on Norway - that country having been alluded to by certain witnesses before the Com- mittee of 1871.  I regret that there are no reliable statistics of mortality and its causes to be obtained from that country.  The following extracted from Simon's Papers on Vaccination is important, disclosing as it does the fact that there are medical men in that country who have the courage to state the truth regarding vaccination.  In the Appendix to Evidence before the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Vaccination, 1871, we have presented to us by Mr. Simon, in a series of Papers professing to be the results of inquiries sent to foreign governments, the following reply from a Committee in Norway (abbreviated) : -  1. - " The Committee feel it their duty to remark that during  " periods of intercurrent epidemics of smallpox, some few fatal " cases have occurred among persons who have been vacci- nated. Our experience dates from 1811, when vaccination " was made obligatory in this country by law."  2. - "With respect to scrofula and phthisis, there are " certainly some medical men of opinion that these diseases " have of late become more prevalent, but as regards this being "attributable to vaccination, we have no experience to warrant " an opinion."  3. - " The Committee do not venture to assert, with positive " facts in view, that other diseases are transmitted by vaccination, " but they cannot avoid remarking that there are in Norway  DENMARK. 85  " enlightened medical men who conceive that they have proofs " of such transmission having taken place."  4. - . . . " The experience of the Committee, as well  " as that of several other medical men, has also shown on " many occasions that infants after vaccination do, not unfre- " quently, become sickly in various ways. The Committee have "not hesitated to recommend deferring it until school-time begins."  DENMARK.  I now submit to the reader the state of Denmark, the second well-vaccinated country, from which, it was said,  smallpox  had been so far banished by vaccination, that for some years not a single death from that disease occurred in Copenhagen.  In 1801 a Royal Commission on Vaccination was appointed.  In 1802 a Vaccination establishment was erected at Copenhagen.  In 1803 the Commission on Vaccination recognizes the protective powers of vaccination.  In 1810 a Decree ordering vaccination was promulgated.  In 1825 the Vaccination Commission was abolished, and vaccination placed under the control of the Board of Health.  In 1834 re-vaccination becomes general.  In 1836 re-vaccination ordered for the army.  In 1844 re-vaccination ordered for the navy.  No child can be admitted into a school, or present itself for confirmation, unless a certificate of vaccination be produced.  The Table handed in by Mr. Simon, illustrating this asser-  86  DENMARK.  tion, will be found at page 410 of the Report of Committee on Vaccination Acts, 1871. That Table, although presented to the Committee of the House of Commons in 1871, ends with the year 1850.  I have received from the Registrar at Copenhagen the later statistics of that City down to the year 1875. It appears that in the recent epidemic a greater number died than in any year since 1801.

In Copenhagen vaccination was made compulsory in 1810, forty-three years before the English Parliament passed a similar law - yet the smallpox death-rate, in the year 1872, was no less than 1,200 per million living.  The severity and general prevalence of the disease in the City of Copenhagen may be inferred from the number that succumbed.  If only 20 per cent, of the attacked died, then at least two thousand persons must have been attacked in a population of two hundred thousand.  In the papers handed in by Mr. Simon as evidence to the Committee of 1871,* it was stated that since the introduction of vaccination into Denmark, so mild was the disease in those who were vaccinated, that only one to five pci- cent, died of those who were attacked during the various epidemics.  If such was a fact ! ! and vaccination was the cause of this wonderful immunity, how comes it that in the late epidemic so many as four hundred deaths occurred ? Then eight thousand of the population must have been stricken down ! !  It is, I submit, high time that these speculating special theorists were banished. Governments should no longer give ear to them. The effect is lamentable in the production of Acts of Parliament which tyrannically enforce medical dogmas on an unwilling people.  TABLE XXXIX.

The recent mortality is double that of the previous sixty years.  The foregoing Table is compiled from the official statistics of Copenhagen, which shows the fluctuation in the mortality, and the enormous increase in the last few years in that City, in which vaccination had been compulsory sixty years, and where re-vaccination since the year 1834 had been generally adopted. The reader will perceive that the number of deaths from smallpox in the five years, 1871-5, was nearly equal to the deaths in the thirty years from 1841 to 1870, the yearly average having increased from 16 to 103.  I think I have presented ample proof that the opinion which I expressed in my evidence before the Select Committee of the House of Commons, viz. : -  9 °  COPENHAGEN MORTALITY.  That, in those countries which had been alluded to as being secured from smallpox by the protection afforded by  vaccination tion, when the epidemic then prevailing in England reached those countries, a very different result would be found.  The facts which I have collected from authorities cannot be set aside, nor can they be even disputed.  They scatter to the winds the theories and opinions ! of a handful of officials and their friends, who formed themselves into a Society called the Epidemiological. They began their career with one of the grossest blunders ever made by a faculty known for its changes of opinion, and palmed it on the Government without fair inquiry  I have demonstrated in the foregoing and following pages the entire fallacy of the foundation on which, unfortunately, legislation on this great and important subject was based, and I urge that is the duty of Parliament to repeal those Compul- sory Acts which are now irritating the people of this country.  That " well-vaccinated " City of Copenhagen in the year 1872 lost 219 by smallpox, and during the epidemic, 495, showing a death-rate in the year 1872 of 1,190 per million living, and in 1875 a death-rate of 927 per million living, shown thus : -   Deaths  Deaths per  Year.

Prussia is another of those countries which have been constantly referred to as affording proof that vaccination has been most effectual in not only mitigating the severity of smallpox, but of stamping it out. No greater mistake was ever made. Misled by men in authority the Newspaper Press has for the last ten years constantly reiterated the statement from time to time " Leaders " and Articles " communicated " in the Daily papers - their authorship has sometimes been traced. The Times, Daily Telegraph, Daily News, Daily Chronicle, and other Daily and Evening papers might be quoted here. , One quotation will suffice.  The Pall Mall Gazette of the 24th May, 1871, circulated the following : -  " Prussia is the country where re-vaccination is most gene- rally practised; the law making the precaution obligatory on " every person, and the authorities conscientiously ( ! ! ) watching " over its performances. As a natural result cases of small  " POX ARE RARE."  This practice of " nobbling the Press " has grown up within the last ten years, and it unfortunately grows with the extension of the " Local Government Board," so called. It is a practice which is incompatible with English notions of a Free Fress. It is execrable and should be suppressed by Parliament. Statements on authority are put forth, which are frequently found to be subversive of truth - yet even if error be apparent no newspaper will admit a reply from any one who is not a holder of office in some department or other, or one who can obtain a hearing through some functionary.  92  MORTALITY IN BERLIN.  The facts now presented to my reader are sufficient to convince every unprejudiced person that there is no truth in the statements made by men in high office, " That in Prussia smallpox was 'stamped out.'" At the time that the "Pall Mall" article appeared the Committee on the Vaccination Acts was sitting from day to day, and smallpox was then raging in Prussia, where no fewer than five thousand, two hundred and sixteen died of smallpox ; and in Berlin City, in three months, one thousand eight hundred and thirty died.  To account for this extraordinary mortality it was suggested that it was owing to neglect there was an accumula- tion of a large number of unvaccinated people. The fact being that there had existed an universal obligation to vaccinate and re-vaccinate in Prussia since the year 1835.  Before proceeding to the statistical refutation of the state- ments, I beg attention to the law in Prussia.  In Mr. Simon's Papers on Vaccination, I find at page 183, the following reply by the authorities of that country to the questions forwarded by Mr. Simon : -  " In case of an epidemic of smallpox, re-vaccination is even " ordered as early as within two years of the period of a previous " successful vaccination  The law on vaccination I quote from the Report, to which I have before alluded, dated 1853.  The law in Prussia is as follows : -  1. - "Every child is required to be vaccinated before it is a "year old. Parents who do not obey, are fined."  " 2. - None are admitted into any school, or " (a) Any public employment,  "(b) Or allowed to marry without a certificate of vaccination.  " 3. - Soldiers are re-vaccinated on entering the army.  COMPULSORY LAW IN PRUSSIA. 93  "4. - It is the duty of every parochial medical officer to vac- cinate every child.  " 5. - Whenever an opportunity presents itself, recourse is had to the cow for fresh lymph. Fifteen shillings reward is given to every person who gives information of a cow being affected."  The Prussian people are pointed to as an example of a well- vaccinated nation, enjoying an immunity from smallpox. This was stated in 1871, by Dr. Seaton, in replying to Question No. 5,603 - "Is Prussia well protected?"  " Prussia is well protected, but in Prussia they leave vacci- nation until the children are twelve months' old."  Again, Dr. Seaton, in replying to Question 5,608, said, "I " know Prussia is well protected."  So far from there being a large accumulation of unvacci- nated people, it was scarcely possible under the stringent laws for enforcing the practice.  The following information respecting Germany was fur- nished by Dr. H. Oidtmann, of Linnich, to the Congress held in Paris, in December, 1880, of the International League of Anti-vaccinators, and is of some importance when we consider what has been stated again and again by the advocates of vaccination.  "In Bavaria an obligatory law has existed since 1807, and more or less obligatory in Nassau since 1808. In Baden since 1809. In Auhalt, in the duchies of Saxe and Electoral Hesse since 1815. In Wurtemburg since 1818, and in Haumer since 1821.  "In all the German States the people submitted willingly to the regulations of the legislature and police.  " Infants were vaccinated within a year after birth. Children who were in schools at ten years of age, and recruits on entering the army."  94  MORTALITY IN BERLIN.  " The proportions of the vaccinated and unvaccinaed does not essentially differ in 1880 from that which existed before the law of 1875. Before that year and since, the number of non- vaccinated oscillated between 9 and 12 per cent., while the vaccinated varies between 9 1 and 80 per cent."  It is remarkable that in Germany, as in England, the same excuses are made when an epidemic of smallpox occurs, for the great mortality. Before the epidemic in 1871 appeared, vac- cination was so complete and so efficient that smallpox had been " stamped out."  In an article by Dr. Boehr, which appeared in la fcuille pcriodiquc Gesundheit, du Professeur Redam , No. 10, we are informed that on the 8th of April, 1878, an Imperial law was enacted in Prussia to make vaccination compulsory. This Act came into operation in 1875, and immediately the'  smallpox  mortality fell lower than it had been for sixty years. Again the old cry was revived when the epidemic has departed. The exclamation is, " See what we have done ! ! "  The following figures show the absurdity of attributing to the law, which came into operation in 1875, ^ is diminution of the number of deaths from smallpox in the two years which preceded it.

In Mr. Simon's Report to the Local Government Board, March, 1875, New Series, No. IV., at page 59, alluding to the recent epidemic, the following statement appears : -  "Prussia was, after France, the first Continental State to "feel the force of the epidemic. The smallpox deaths in "Prussia, which in 1870 were 4,200, rose in 1871 to 69,839, " equivalent to a death-rate of 2,430 per million living,  " OR VERY NEARLY TWICE AND A HALF THE smallPOX DEATH-  " rate in England for the same year."  Prussia " well-vaccinated " suffered more severely than other States in which but comparatively few were vaccinated. Berlin shared in the general disappointment, and failure of vaccination and re-vaccination was made manifest.  In the three months ending December 31st 1871, there died of smallpox in Berlin 1830 persons.  In London, in the same period, there died 980. The popu- lation of London being four times greater than that of Berlin had the mortality been in proportion to population, there would have died in London, 7,320 : there only died 980, which divided by four would give 245 for Berlin. The mortality in that City so completely vaccinated was therefore seven times heavier than that of London in the same epidemic under which we were suffering.  How unwelcome must have been those tidings to Simon, Seaton & Co., and to those eminent members of the Profession, who only a few months previously, expressed to the Committee of the House of Commons their opinion regarding the safety of that well-vaccinated country, Prussia.  96 PRUSSIA "well protected."  I may here observe that the hand which drew up the Report of 1853, referred to at the commencement of this Essay - the hand of Dr. Seaton penned the following lines at page 5 1 of the " Report of Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, New Series, No. IV." In alluding to the epidemic of 1871-2, he said : -  " In every country attacked, so far as our information "extends, the peculiar intensity of this epidemic was mani- " fested by the extreme diffuseness of the disease, by its " attacking [and killing in unusual proportions persons who were " regarded as ' protected ' against the disease  At page 60 of the same Report, Dr. Seaton is painfully com- pelled to write the following : -  " For Berlin the statistics are complete for the whole period " of the epidemic which lasted in that City from the latter part "of 1870 until July, 1872. The deaths from smallpox in 1871 "amounted to 5,084, or 6U5 per thousand of the population, " equivalent to a death-rate from smallpox of six thousand,  " ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER MILLION LIVING."  The gentleman (Dr. Seaton) who recorded this, the successor of Mr. Simon, Medical Officer to the Privy Council and Local Government Board, President of the Vaccination Department, in his evidence before the Vaccination Committee of 1S71, in reply to Question No. 5,608, said: -  " I know Prussia is well protected."  In Mr. Simon's "Papers on Vaccination," 1857, at page xxiii., it is stated that in Berlin, from 1S01 to 1850, the average death-rate from smallpox was 176 per million living. And that statement was made in support of the theory that in well- vaccinated countries there was very little smallpox. At the Very hour when this statement was revived by " official " wit- nesses under examination, and believed in by the Committee,  PRUSSIA CONTINUED.  97  smallpox was doing its work in vaccinated Prussia, where in that and the preceding year more than seventy-four thousand persons fell victims.  Thus the boasted effects of vaccination in reducing the death-rate to 176 per million was exchanged for a mortality of 2,430 per million in a vaccinated and re-vaccinated population.  The death-rate in the whole country of Prussia was the same as that for London only, where the mortality was heaviest.  I have thus, as briefly as possible, disposed of the three countries, Sweden, Denmark, and Prussia, lauded all over Europe as the most vaccinated and best protected countries in the world.  I need not here reproduce proof of the freely expressed testi- mony of the numerous officials and doctors to that theory. I close this chapter by simply quoting Mr. Simon's statement in the year 1871 : -  " In Sweden the mortality from smallpox is now one "thirteenth of what it was. In Berlin, and a large part of " Austria, but a twentieth. In Copenhagen one eleventh."  Alas ! for vaccination protection.  Appended is a Table (A) showing the smallpox death-rate per million living in Prussia, from 1816 to 1S71. It will be observed that the increased mortality, the heaviest in the century, was after seventy years of diligent vaccination.  Table (B) was presented by Dr. Seaton to show the compa- rative mortality in two vaccinated countries, Prussia and England. It is here again remarkable that well-vaccinated Prussia presented a greater mortality than England, 2430 to 1024.  H  9 8  PRUSSIA CONTINUED.  TABLE XLI (A).

AUSTRIA- ITS STATES AND CITIES.  In the Report of the Epidemiological Society, before referred to, I find the following information obtained by the Society from the Austrian authorities : -  1. - Austria is divided into districts (called Mr eiss) for vacci- nation, with a surgeon and physician to each. Each district contains on -the average from 30,000 to 120,000 inhabitants, and extends over about 50,000 German square miles.  2. - The duties of the surgeons are to go over their districts two or three times a year, vaccinating all the children who have not yet been vaccinated. He has no other vocation than this, and to see that the vaccination is successful. He is paid by the Government.  3. - The law of vaccination is compulsory in an indirect manner. Thus no child or young person can be received into any school, or house of education, public or private. No person can receive any appointment under Government, civil or military, or can have any help or support from the State, without bringing his certificate of successful vaccination.  4. - Any person applying to the Charity Boards for relief of any kind, must produce the certificate of vaccination of them- selves and their entire families. If they do not fulfil this obligation the relief is not given.  5. - Whenever the police learn that there are individuals who have not been vaccinated, they have the power of forcing them to submit to the operation.  6. - A certificate of vaccination cannot be admitted as suffi-  TYRANNY OF AUSTRIAN LAW.  IOI  cient, unless the person producing it has either marks of vaccination left, or of having had the smallpox.  7. - As soon as the inhabitant of any house is attacked with smallpox, the medical attendant is to give notice thereof immediately to the police, who have orders to give public warning by fixing on the door of the house a placard con- taining the following words : -  " Here at Mr. N n's there is smallpox.  And all communications with the inmates is immediately cut off, till the eruption is dried up, and the crusts fall off."  8. - The remains of a person who has died from smallpox must not be followed to the grave by parents, relations, or friends, under the most severe penalties. "The law admits of  NO EXCEPTION WHATEVER."  The following Tables (XLII. & XLIII.) appeared in the Re- port of the Epidemiological Society, before referred to, showing the number of deaths from smallpox in each year, from 1841 to 1850.

The general sub- sidence of all malignant fevers throughout Europe towards the close of the 1 8th century was not taken into consideration. Hence the false deductions shown so manifestly in other portions of this Essay.  TABLE X L I V .  Provinces.  Population- 1 870  Deaths  from  smallpox,  1871.

To the foregoing Table (XLIV.) quoted from the Reports of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council and Local Government Board, New Series, 1875, the following note is appended : -  " In Austria (exclusive of Hungary, for which there Is no "complete return) the total smallpox deaths in 1871 were " 7,389, and in 1872, 37,878. The deaths in Vienna in 1871-2 " amounted to 3,807. The official returns do not distinguish " the ages at death, and state there are no materials for giving "them."  I have not calculated the death-rate per million living. Th population being given, and the number of deaths, a sum in the Rule of Three only is needed.  For the sake of comparison, however, I have calculated the death-rate of the total number to the entire population, the result showing a death-rate from smallpox, in the year 1872, of one thousand, eight hundred and eighty, per million.  For the purpose of comparison with other Continental cities, I append the following Table, showing the mortality from smallpox in the epidemic of 1870-1-2, adding London thereto. Looking to the four most important cities, London, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, they rank as follows in the order of mor- tality in one year : - Death-rate from smallpox per million living: - Berlin, 6,310; Paris, 5,720; Vienna, 5,170; London, 2,430. German}^, where vaccination has been compulsorily enforced for sixty years, presents a mortality in excess over London with its population of nearly four millions.  MORTALITY IN FOREIGN STATES.

The following Table (XLVI.) is an extract from the valu- able work on the subject, by Dr. Adolph Vogt, of Berne.  It is valuable, showing not only the fluctuations during half a century of smallpox mortality, but proving that under the most stringent laws for enforcing vaccination and re-vaccination, the deaths from smallpox have steadily increased, reaching in the year 1872, five thousand one hundred and seventy per million.  Taking averages of ten years, the following are the annual death-rates per million living : -  1835 to 1844 ... ... ... ... ... 469  1848 to 1857 ... ... ... ... ... 395  1868 to 1877 ... ... ... ... ...1,163  This increased mortality in Vienna, the Capital of the Austrian dominions, where vaccination is tyrannically enforced by law and police.

Thanks to Dr. Vogt, of Berne, however, we have the information as far as regards Vienna and Berlin.  Not only have we the ages at death, from infancy to advanced age, but each authority, Dr. Muller, of Berlin, and Dr. Keller, of Vienna, has furnished us with the very desirable information regarding the mortality-rate in the vacci- nated and the unvaccinated.  Such information is interesting, inasmuch as in English smallpox hospitals it has been stated that the mortality in the unvaccinated is about six times greater than in the vaccinated.  The following Table furnished by Dr. Vogt contrasts very unfavourably for the vaccinators, with the returns furnished by the Asylums Board Hospitals of London.  The difference in the rate between the vaccinated and unvaccinated is so slight, as to justify the respective Govern- ments to abolish forthwith all compulsory laws, and withdraw all endowment from vaccination.

Dr. Leander Joseph Keller, Head Physician of the Imperial Austrian State Railway Company, four years since presented a Report " On smallpox cases among the employes  no  dr. keller's statistics.  of that Company, in the years 1872-3." The extensiveness of the inquiry by Dr. Keller may be appreciated when it is learnt that the Company employs constantly thirty-seven thousand officials, who with the addition of wives, children, pensioners, &c., represent altogether a population of 55,000 to 60,000. This population is divided among 195 railroad stations, 1 1 principal work depots, with 92 villages, with colleries, colonies, and lands. Eighty medical men are employed. Their duty is to attend all cases of illness in the workmen and their families. They keep exact records of all cases, and each month, and each year, send a full report to the Directors. The Head Physician has the special oversight of all. Dr. Keller honours that office. Now for the figures.  In 1873 there were 2,054 cases of smallpox. Of these, 1,669  recovered; 385 died. The  deaths per  cent.  were 1874.  Among these cases were : -  Cases.  Died.  Death-rate.  Vaccinated  • 1337  219  16-38  Unvaccinated  • 596  148  24 - 83  Re-vaccinated  46  7  15-22  Had smallpox previously  . 11  2  18-18  Doubtful .  64  9  14-06  The greatest mortality is in  the first two  years of life. This  mortality diminishes in the  following periods,  reaches its  minimum between 15 and 20  and again  rapidly  increases in  advancing ages.  This graduated scale corresponds with the general death- rate of mankind.  The following results astounding as they may appear to English " Authorities," cannot be called in question.  The death-rate in the first year of life among the unvaccinated was 45-24 per cent. In the second year of life 3S , to per cent.  In the vaccinated in the first year of life was 60-46, and in the second year of life was 5 4 '05.  DR. KELLER CONTINUED.  Ill  It is clearly seen, therefore, that the mortality was greater in the vaccinated.  In the two years, 1872 and 1873, 2,627 cases of smallpox were treated. Of these 2,151 or82 , is per cent, recovered, while 469 or 17 '85 per cent. died.  If we examine the mortality of these smallpox patients as a whole, with reference to the varying scale of ages, we find pre- cisely such a decreasing and then again increasing death-rate as corresponds with the general mortality of the human race. But we find just the same series of variations, if we examine sepa- rately the mortality of the vaccinated and of the unvaccinated in the various life-periods. The following percentages result :  TABLE XLVIII.  Showing the ages at death of Vaccinated and Unvaccinated.  In the first year of life  Vaccinated.

The arithmetical sequence of death percentages is only a little disturbed among the vaccinated between the 4th and 5th, among the unvacci-  I 12  DR. KELLER CONTINUED.  nated between the ioth and 15th years of life; and on a larger number of cases would undoubtedly right itself.  If we now compare the death-rate of the vaccinated and the unvaccinated in the different life-periods, we find that the cases of the unvaccinated between the ioth and 40th year, in which comparatively very few cases occurred, yield a somewhat higher death-rate, whereas in all the other periods, and especially in the first years of life, they show' a much lighter death-rate than the vaccinated. Notwithstanding these, for the unvaccinated, very favourable proportions, the total death-rate of all the life-periods shows 23'2o per cent, for the unvaccinated, and only i5'6i for the vaccinated. For here arise precisely the same circumstances as we observed in our previous examination of the cases of the year 1873.  This raising of the death-rate of the unvaccinated is referable solely to the cases in the first two years ofi life. If namely we exclude (from the total mortality, vaccinated 659, died 25 9 - iS'6x percent.; unvaccinated 793, died 184 - 23^20 per cent Table C) the two first years of life, the death-rate of the vacci- nated (of 1570 died 210) amounts to i3'37 per cent : that of the unvaccinated of 515 died 66) to 12 '82 per cent, so that from the second year of life onwards the death-rate of the unvacci- nated is more favourable than that of the vaccinated.  What is here said of the results of the year 1873 will be shown as clearly from the combined Tables of 1872 and 1873, so I will only observe now, that statistical tables of smallpox cases in which age (and the normal death-rate) is left out of sight, are quite worthless as regards a decision on the question what influe?icc vaccination may have exercised, even if they have been quite correctly and conscientiously drawn up, which unfortunately is very seldom the case.  I cannot do better than to place before my readers the fol-   SUMMARY OF DR. KELLER'S STATISTICS. 113  lowing summary of Dr. Keller, which is deserving the attention of all Governments and all peoples.  Dr. Keller says : -  " If we now summarise the results of these statistics, we arrive at the following conclusions : -  1. - Vaccinated and unvaccinated, re-vaccinated, and those who had previously suffered from smallpox, were alike attacked ; the overwhelming majority of the cases were vacci- nated, doubtless because there are, except in the first two years of life, many more vaccinated than unvaccinated persons.  2. - In the first two years of life many more unvaccinated than vaccinated children were attacked by smallpox, because at that age there are many more unvaccinated than vaccinated children in Austria.  3. - The death-rate in the first two years of life is in all cases the highest, the death-rate in very advanced age alone excepted ; still it was lower among the unvaccinated than among the vaccinated children of this period of life.  4. - If we set aside these two first years of life the death-rate is nearly equal for vaccinated and unvaccinated, but still some- what less favourable to the vaccinated.  5. - If the mortality of the total unvaccinated cases is higher in proportion than that of the vaccinated, this is not to be ascribed to non-vaccination, but only to the greater proportion of this large mortality occurring in the first years of childhood.  6. - The mortality in the different periods of life follows, both with vaccinated and unvaccinated, the ordinary law of mor- tality of the human race in these respective periods, and vaccination has no power to alter or affect this law of nature.  7. - Having due regard to all these facts, it appears that vaccination is utterly worthless.  If we now only cursorily examine, with an unprejudiced eye,  1  1 14 STATISTICS 0 ORTALITY.  the important results which I have here collected from the practice of no less than 80 medical men employed on the railway lines and works, we must at once recognise what great weight attaches to the statement of age in all returns of  smallpox  cases, if we wish to draw any conclusions from such returns as to the value of vaccination. It is inconceivable that at the present day reports of smallpox cases should be relied on, in which no mention is made of the age of the patients , and that from such reports the friends of vaccination would fain draw the conclusion that vaccination exercises some degree of pro- tective power, because the mortality of the unvaccinated is, as a rule, greater than that of the vaccinated. That this is the case we see confirmed in the above reports ; but often and often has it already been proven to pro-vaccinators that other considera- tions, besides that already dwelt on of the tender age of the unvaccinated, must here be taken into consideration, of which I will only mention, one, viz. : " That only the healthy children are vaccinated, and the sickly ones, as a mile, are left unvaccinatcdP  Having disposed of Austria and its capital, Vienna, I append the following Table, for which we are indebted to Dr. Vogt, showing the smallpox mortality in fourteen of the prin- cipal cities, for fourteen years - 1864 to 1S77 - to which is added London, for the purpose of comparison. With the aid of a map the route of the great epidemic of 1870 may be traced from city to city, until its subsidence in 1S75.  It will be readily seen that the " well-vaccinated " Berliners suffered a death-rate of six thousand three hundred and ten per million, in the year 1871, while that of London was only two thousand four hundred and thirty per million.  It might weary the reader were I to adduce a greater multitude of statistics of smallpox mortality which I have col- lected, comprising more than a century, of Countries, States, and Cities. Enough is presented in this Essay to convince the most sceptical, of the fallacy so popular, that vaccination has been an advantage to the world.

Before concluding this portion of the Essay, however, I give some account of the epidemic of 1870-71 among our nearest Continental neighbours.  In France, the epidemic of smallpox began in the closing months of the year 1869. The French Government in the spring of 1870, instituted calf vaccination to avoid the serious risk of arm-to-arm vaccination.  The Municipal Council of Paris voted xo,ooo francs for gratuitous vaccination with this calf lymph. The people availed themselves of this provision, and it is said as many as 2,000 persons presented themselves in one morning alone.  Vaccinations and re-vaccinations were performed on thousands, but these fell victims to the smallpox equally with the unvaccinated.  In the year 1870, 10,539 died of smallpox in Paris alone, as seen in the following Table (L), the death-rate reaching no less than five thousand seven hundred and twenty per million living.  It will be observed, that Paris alarmed at the mortality of 1868-9, amounting to 1,378 in the two years, calf vaccination was resorted to, calves being led through the streets of the City. This which was to stamp out the smallpox, was fol- lowed in the same year by a mortality of ten thousand five hundred persons in Paris alone.  MORTALITY IN CITY OF PARIS.  "7  TABLE L.- PARIS.

Although there was no compulsory law in France, that country has been alluded to by Dr. Seaton, as having done the proper thing in bestowing rewards, prizes, gold and silver medals to vaccinators, to encourage them in the performance of their work.  The following quotation from the Report of the Epidemio- logical Society, 1853, is ominous -  "In France and Belgium, rewards (prizes, and gold and " silver medals) are given to vaccinators, while in Great " Britain no inducements are held out to medical men to encourage "them to exertion" [Page 9].  At page 18, complaint is made of "the pitiful remuneration of vaccinators in England."  Clause vi. of the Act of 1853 was passed to provide for the better payment of vaccinators everywhere, and now our public vaccinators are not only fairly remunerated for each case, but in addition have awarded to them considerable sums for what in the opinion of the paid Medical Inspectors of the Local Government Board, are called, successful vaccinations.  No Country or City on the Continent of Western Europe was spared from the ravages of the last general smallpox epidemic.  In France, during the war with Prussia, the smallpox broke out in Strasburg, and extended through the country.  In Paris alone it carried off fifteen thousand persons, and it has been estimated that in the whole of that country nearly two hundred thousand persons were carried off by smallpox.  Italy was a sufferer also. In Milan alone nearly 3,000 persons were carried off, and it was observed there that the percentage of deaths was about equal in the vaccinated and  THE UNVACCINATED.  Austria, in all its various States suffered severely as I  LEIPSIC MORTALITY. II 9  have shown. A country, too, where vaccination had been enforced by tyranny through the police.  Leipsic, where vaccination has long been universally enforced, the mortality among the vaccinated was as severe as in the unvaccinated.  The following quotation from an able work by one of the Professors of the University, Dr. Germann, is interesting. The work is entitled, " Historic and Critical Studies on the Present State of the Vaccination Question; " in 3 vols.  At pages 62-63, Superintending-Surgeon Reitz, is quoted thus : -  " In the beginning of the century, when the number of vaccinated persons in the population was comparatively incon- siderable, the number of smallpox cases among these was also naturally much less than among the unvaccinated remainder, then nearly the whole of the population. When, however, as years went on, vaccination being universally enforced, the number of the vaccinated continually increased, we find a progressive increase of smallpox cases among the vaccinated, till in these last times, when almost the whole population, excepting very young children are vaccinated, the number of smallpox cases among unvaccinated adults have become vanishing small.  " Precisely the same is the case with re-vaccination. For what vaccination cannot do, that can re-vaccination do just as little. So long as the percentage of the re-vaccinated in the population was small, the number of re-vaccinated smallpox cases was small also, as must from the above have been expected ; but with the extension of re-vaccination has the percentage of re-vaccinated smallpox cases increased. Everywhere re-vacci- nated smallpox patients were to be found, till their number often considerably exceeded that of the unvaccinated."  120  VACCINATION LA S IN HANOVER.  At page 105 of this Essay (Table XLV.) the reader will find a summary of the smallpox mortality in fifteen Cities, con- trasted with that of London.  The following brief notices of some of these places may be interesting in relation to the degree of enforcement of  vaccination tion in various Countries, not alluded to in the foregoing text of this Essay.  In Hanover the first edict on vaccination was issued on the 24th April, 1821. The second edict on the 15th August, 1839. These two edicts are in substance as follows : -  1. Every subject is bound to have the children under his authority or care vaccinated.  2. In May and June, each year, a general vaccination is per- formed. To this vaccination, all children born in the previous year must be brought, who have not had smallpox or cowpox or have been already vaccinated three times ineffectually.  3. The children whose vaccination has not been successful, must be brought again to the next public vaccination, until they shall have been vaccinated with effect.  Yet in Hanover the smallpox has raged, defying the lymph-charged lancet to arrest or even to mitigate its severity.  In Frankfort, proclamation was made on the 20th November, 1805, that vaccination was advisable. On the 6th September  J  18 1 1, it was made compulsory. Thus: -  1.

Yet in Frankfort the smallpox death-rate in 1871 was four- teen hundred per million persons living.  In Rotterdam the public vaccination of the City has been conducted since 1799, by an Association of 16 ordinary members, and of extraordinary and honorary members. The first name inscribed in the list of honorary members was that of Edward Jenner.  It has, since its foundation, performed the public vaccination of Rotterdam, and distributed lymph through Holland and its Colonies.  Early in 1868 the Society opened a second station - for the practice of animal vaccination - relying on the statements that had been made as to the results of animal vaccination in France and Belgium.  With what result is seen in the fact that in the year 1871, the death-rate was fourteen thousand two hundred and eighty per million living.  In Hamburgh there are no laws to enforce vaccination, but no child can be admitted into the schools without a certificate of vaccination.  In the year 1871, the death-rate from smallpox was fifteen thousand four hundred and forty per million living.  In Belgium, vaccination was enforced : - 1st, by Royal decree, dated 18th April, 18x8. It was made imperative on all persons receiving relief from any public charitable fund, and to cause children not having had smallpox naturally, or by inoculation, to be vaccinated.  122  BRUSSELLS AND CALF LYMPH.  2nd. It applied to all institutions where children are received and maintained, partly supported by endowments or private benevolence, but subsidised from public sources.  Gold medals of encouragement are awarded to practitioners who pay particular attention to gratuitous vaccination.  In 1850, a new decree was issued, specially applying to vaccination, appointment of vaccinators, their duties, and remuneration.  In 1852, amendments were made in respect to these two points.  Yet in Brussels the epidemic was felt severely, calf-lymph notwithstanding.  VICARIOUS MORTALITY.  123  VICARIOUS MORTALITY.  There is a prevailing belief that the visitations of epidemics seriously increase the mortality ; that smallpox, cholera, and other severe and malignant diseases, add very seriously to the number of deaths. This belief, however, is not founded on facts.  People hear of the ravages made by smallpox, and of the thousands who die, and imagine that so many deaths are added to the general mortality.  It is a remarkable fact, however, that as a rule, there is no addition to the general death-rate, but a diminution in the death-rate during the epidemic.  When giving evidence before the Committee of the House of Commons, in 1871, I stated this as a general law. My observations were received by the Committee with great scepticism.  I had noticed in studying the subject of epidemics, that when smallpox prevailed, the general death-rate was less. There was, indeed, a saving of 3,000 per million in the general mortality ; also that in the absence of smallpox the death-rate was heavier.  Since going to press, the Annual Report of Dr. Tripe, Medical Officer of Health for Hackney has appeared, in which he states : -  " The death-rate for the district has been exceedingly small, as only 350 deaths of inhabitants were registered in the district, and with 18 added for deaths in the Atlas Floating  124  VICARIOUS MORTALITY IN SWEDEN.  smallpox Hospital, gives the very low death-rate of 137 per thousand inhabitants per annum, against 2o - 6 for all London."  This shows a saving of no less than seven thousand per million persons living.  In the volume which I published in 1868,* I elucidated the law of substitution, a law of vicarious mortality which con- trolled the general mortality in epidemics of Zymotic diseases.  I referred to Sweden as well as to various other countries, besides the United Kingdom, in illustration of that law.  In reference to Sweden, I stated in a comment on the Tables furnished by the Swedish Government, that so far from small, pox adding to the general mortality, it not infrequently occurs, that when it is present, and the mortality considerable, the general mortality is lessened.  I gave the following instances in which the law of displace- ment or vicarious mortality was so apparent in regard to Sweden.  In the year 1829 there  The mortality from all  died of smallpox ... 53  Causes in 1829 was 82719  In the year 1853 there  The mortality from all  died of smallpox ... 1145  Cansesini833 fell to 63947  The whole mortality was thus 18,772 more than when the smallpox mortality was low.  Again in 1846 the mortality from smallpox was only two in the year ; the mortality from all causes was 72,683.  In 1851 smallpox rose to 2,488, when the mortality from all causes fell to 72,506 - 727 less than when the smallpox  * Vaccination; its Tested Effects on Health, Mortality, and Population.

Turning to Mr. Simon's Papers on Vaccination, page 161, I find a Report of the Faculty of Medicine, at Prague, confirm- ing the prevalence of the law which I have illustrated, proving that no saving of life has been effected by vaccination.

Twelve years since I published the foregoing instances in illustration of the law of substitution which I had discovered years before. We have been lately favoured by Rektor P. A. Siljestrom, of Stockholm, with an ample chart, showing the fluctuations in mortalities, extending over a period of 104  126  rektor siljestrom's evidence.  years - from 1774 to 1880. In commenting on the chart, the Swedish Committee completely confirms the prevalence of the law which I had elucidated. The following is a notable illus- tration. He says : -  "The following conclusions may be drawn from these " returns :  " 1st. - Formerly smallpox did not have the enormous " influence on the general mortality that has been attributed "to it comparatively with other epidemic diseases. For "example, comparing the year 1778, when smallpox was "excessive [16,607 deaths] with the years 1809, 1829, and " 1857, when this mortality (from smallpox) was either of little " importance or nearly nil, it is found that for the first-named " year the general mortality was 55,028, and for the last three "named years, respectively 63,233, 75,998, and 97,898. Also "in 1874, smallpox mortality being very considerable, general "mortality was however less than that of the years 1810 and " 1852, when smallpox mortality had little importance. And "even in 1800, when not only the mortality by smallpox but " also the general mortality was extraordinary, this latter mor- " tality was less considerable, taking population into account, "than in the years 1808 and 1809, and so on. Consequently " if the smallpox could by any means have been got rid of, it " would probably have no influence on the general mortality. If " the latter mortality has become less, the causes must be sought for " in the social ameliorations, political, economical, and hygienic, " of our period.''  The following Table (No. LI.) shows at a glance the foregoing facts.  VICARIOUS MORTALITY IN SWEDEN.  127  TABLE LI.

In my evidence before the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Vaccination Acts 1871, I stated (see page 40 of the Blue Book) that when smallpox prevailed, there was usually a reduction in the general mortality, and I recited the fact that according to the Registrar-General's Returns for England and Wales, in the year 1838, when smallpox killed 16,268 persons, the smallpox was the fifth most fatal disease, the general death-rate to 1,000 living was 2 2 '240.  In the year 1864, when smallpox only killed 7,684, it occu- pied the eighteenth place on the list of fatal diseases, and now the general death-rate to 1,000 living had increased to 23 - 890 .

Here it is seen that smallpox went down from 16,000 to 5,000, while scarlatina went up from 10,000 to 19,000, the mortality from all causes being 17,000 less when smallpox was at its worst.  This law of displacement or substitution of one disease for another, is also seen in the interchange of typhus and  smallpox . In Sweden for instance : -  Year.

The Report for 1803 of the cowpock inoculation at the Vaccine-pock Institution, London, written by the Physician to the Institute, at page hi, tells us : -  " It is not manifest that the vaccine inoculation has been a " benefit to population, however great a one it has been to " individuals."  There were thirteen physicians, among whom were the celebrated Drs. Pearson, Keats, Brande, Nelson, and Carpue.  The statement of these thirteen physicians was approved by the President, the Earl of Cholmondley, the Right Hon. Lord  NO SAVING OF LIFE BY VACCINATION. 1 29  Petre, Sir George Baker, Bart., Sir W.

They had the bills of mortality of London, and it was demonstrated that there was no saving of life by vaccination. When they published their report of four years work, 30,000 vaccinations had been performed in London within the bills of mortality.

The assertion made by Mr. Simon and Dr. Seaton, when examined by the Committee of 1871, as well as by every other witness presented by the pro-vaccinators , on that occasion, viz., - that a vast saving of life had been effected by vaccination - is so egregiously false that I cannot withhold the facts which I now present in confirmation of my individual evidence before the same Committee.  The following Table illustrates the interchange of Zymotic diseases, and the lessened mortality during smallpox in London : -  1871.  For the week ending January jth : -  •  1st Week's Deaths.  5th Week's Deaths.  Scarlatina  Il6  55  smallpox  79  196  Under 5 years of age  651  603  All Causes  1828  16S3  Thus when smallpox deaths were 79, the mortality for all causes was 1,828. In the fifth week smallpox went up to 916, the whole mortality from all causes then fell from r,S2S to 1,683, a diminution of 145. At the same time the mortality under 5 years of age was diminished from 651 to 603 when smallpox increased.  CHOLERA AND PLAGUE.   The same law prevails when those fatal diseases, cholera and diarrhoea, are present. Though they may slay their thousands, there is no general increase in the mortality.  The following Tables shew this; in reference to  Year Cholera in England.  1849, there died of Cholera  ,, ,, of Diarrhoea  Total...

Let us go back to the days when Plague took the lead as Death's messenger, and we find the same law controlling the Zymotic fatality.  Plague in London.  Seven Years.  Died of Plague.

Four hundred and seventy seven fewer persons died when plague swept off nearly fifteen thousand persons.  The foregoing is a striking confirmation of the observation of Thucydides, the Greek historian, who said : -  " During the plague at Athens other diseases declined, and " besides this, none of those diseases to -which they were accus- " tomed affected them at that time, or whatever there was " ended in this ."  These illustrations might be multiplied to any extent I think those I have recited are sufficient to expose the error so constantly put before the public that smallpox has saved millions of lives.  I am prepared to prove from the records of the Registrar-  /  General that the prevalence of smallpox is always accompanied by a saving of life, as exhibited in the diminution of the deaths from all causes.  While writing this page, I have opened the " Annual Summary" of the Registrar-General for 1880, just issued, June, 1881.  Speaking of the decade, 1871-80, the Registrar-General says : -  " One disease alone in the class [Zymotic] showed excep- " tionally a rise, and no inconsiderable one. This was small " pox, which owing to the two outbreaks of 1S71-2 and 1S77-S, " gave a death-rate of nearly fifty per cent, above the previous " average of smallpox. . . . The decennium which closed  "with the year 1880, was of lower mortality in London than "any of the preceding decennial periods."  VICARIOUS MORTALITY.  T 33  If we ask how this is to be explained, here is the solution : -  Ten Years ending.  Died of smallpox.  Died of Scarlatina.  Died of Fever.  1S70  8347  397 M  27 M 9  1880  i 555 i  25598  12997  Decrease...  14116  14152  Thus when the smallpox mortality was nearly doubled, i.e. increased by 7,204, that from scarlatina diminished by 14,116, that from fever diminished by 14,152.  The whole mortality from all causes was reduced from 24^4 per thousand persons living in London to 22-8 per thousand, showing a saving of life to the extent of one thousand six hundred per million, which represents, taking the population at 3,500,000, a saving of five thousand six hundred lives.  While I write,  smallpox  is prevalent in the eastern district of London.  The mortality from smallpox increases, but the general mor- tality diminishes. It is now 2 - o per thousand less than when smallpox approached the locality - that is, it has gone down from 2 2 *o per thousand to 20'o.  Surely such facts should lead men to shun those professed exponents like the Thames Police Court Magistrate, who committed a mother (and infant) to gaol, for refusing to vacci- nate, telling her " she was a foolish woman, for vaccination had saved millions of lives."  If the reader will refer to the Chapter on Infant Mortality, he will find further illustrations of the law elucidated above in reference to infantile life.  134  INFANT MORTALITY.  INFANT MORTALITY.  Of the various branches in which the study of vaccination may be pursued, perhaps the most important of all is its effect on Infant Mortality.  T he statements made by the advocates of the process as to the saving of millions of lives, has been refuted again and again. The persistent adherence to an opinion without foundation, betokens either a lack of competency to apprehend the truth, or an obstinate and wilful maintenance of that which is untrue, because established and endowed.  It is surprising that the educated and professional classes of Society should be so credulous as to accept the dicta of State- aided and State-constituted authorities, without examination.  The ex-parte statements made by Police Magistrates and Judges, who should be the last to accept as evidence the theories and speculations of their guides, is discreditable. The " Bar," it is hoped, will yet be awakened to their duty, and not continue in the face of actual evidence , to fine and imprison a parent for protecting his child from that which he believes to be a pollution.  I cannot refrain from expressing here my strong conviction that Infant vaccination is a crime, and the law which enforces it is chargeable not with child slaughter only, but what is worse than death, the perpetual defilement of the body, and conse- quent deterioration, a sin to be transmitted to the third and fourth generation.  MR. GEORGE GIBBS' EVIDENCE.  *35  I have in other parts of this Essay shown that the general mortality is not increased when smallpox prevails, but on the contrary, is a gain to population. This was plainly shown in my evidence before the Select Committee in 1871.  After all that has been said on the saving of infant life, it may appear strange to those who have never made the subject an object of inquiry, that the law of vicarious mortality, elucidated in the foregoing chapter, also prevails in reference to infant life.  Perusal of my evidence before the Committee of 1871, will convince every mind open to information, that there is no saving, but a loss of life in children under five years of age by vaccination.  Mr. George Gibbs subsequently supported and strengthened my statement by the production to the Committee of a list of figures, abstracted from the Registrar-General's returns. At page 337 of the Report of the Select Committee, the Table then presented will be found.  It gives the number of deaths from all causes of children under five years of age in fifteen years, 1839 to 1853, prior to the Compulsory Vaccination Act of 1853 coming into force, and the number during fifteen years after the passing of the Act, viz., 1854 to 1868.  In the first period, the deaths were 2,239,758, and in the second period, 2,769,220.  The death-rate per million living, therefore, was in the first period, 132,240; and in second period, 137,671; the mean annual death-rate being 8,8x6 and 9,178, showing a loss of 362 per million of population, equivalent to a loss of 108,600 lives in a population of 20 millions.  Nothing can be more convincing than these facts.  I distinctly assured the Committee that no saving of infant  136 MR. SIMON AND DR. PEARCE.  life had resulted from vaccination. The Committee seemed startled by the statement, while a suspicious smile was obser- vable on the countenances of some of the members, more distinctly apparent in the Doctors.  This, so-considered, bold statement called forth a desire for further information. The incredulous Medical Officer of the Privy Council was appealed to, and the following Table was ordered to be furnished by the Registrar-General to the Com- mittee of the House of Commons, in 1871, at the suggestion of Mr. Simon, with the object of proving that " Dr. Pearce had talked nonsense when he stated that there had been no saving of lives by vaccination ," either of the whole population, or of children.

EPIDEMIC OF 1838-40.  138  When Mr. Simon produced the blank " form " to be filled up, as above, to the Committee, Mr. W. E. Forster reminded him that the department was so fully occupied with the Census returns, that he thought it not advisable to apply to the Registrar-General's office. Mr. Simon still urged upon the Committee the desirableness of obtaining the returns which he had suggested, in order to refute the statement I had  MADE TO THE COMMITTEE.  Disappointed as well as surprised at the result, when the above return was produced before Mr. Simon, at a sitting of the Committee, no more was said than that the facts were astounding. But they confirmed the evidence which I had presented to the Committee from various sources.  It is plainly shown in the foregoing return of the Registrar- General,  1 st. That, as shown in column No. 1, which included the longest enduring and the heaviest epidemic of smallpox in the present century, 183810 1842, when the death-rate from smallpox amounted to five hundred and seventy one per million persons living the deaths from all causes were fewer than in either of the whole series of columns.  2nd. That so far from the Infant mortality of this country being diminished (as vainly boasted) by the general adoption and enforcement of vaccination, it has vastly increased. Thus in column No. 6, it is shown that the death-rate from smallpox was only 145 per million living. The deaths from all causes, of children under five years of age, were 3,480 per million more  than in the heaviest smallpox mortality year, shown in column No. 1.  Let me, however, go further, and bring to bear on this subject evidence of a most important nature, to which Dr. Farr has called attention, and which is contained in my evidence before the Committee in 1871.  DR. ROBERT WATT ON smallPOX. 139  It was in 1856 I first called attention to the law of substitu- tion, which is so completely confirmed by the following.  Dr. Robert Watt, of Glasgow, lecturer on the theory and practice of Medicine in Glasgow, published in the year 1813 a treatise on chin-cough (whooping-cough). He dedicated the treatise to Sir Gilbert Blane.  Dr. Watt gave the following Table to show that vaccination had diminished the mortality from smallpox which in  1783 to  1788  ...  was  20  in  100  1789 to  1794  ...  was  w  00  in  TOO  1795 to  1800  ...  was  l 9  in  100  w  CO  O  M  r-t-  O  1806  ...  was  9  in  100  0  4-"  r-  O  CO  w  1812  ...  was  4  in  100  Dr. Watt states that this " gratifying result of vaccination was "counterbalanced by a slight increase in the proportion of " deaths by whooping-cough, and a great increase in the deaths " by measles  Dr. Watt then makes the astounding discovery, that " In the first period, when a third of all the deaths under "five years of age were caused by smallpox, a child had the " best chance of reaching its tenth year."  He says : " I began to reflect how different the case must " be now. In eight years little more than 600 died of small "pox, whereas in one year, 1784, the deaths by that disease " alone amounted to 425, and in 1791 to 607 ; which on both "occasions exceeded the fourth of the whole deaths in the year}' In 1808, when smallpox only carried off 5 per cent, of the number who died, still half, or more than one half of the children born, perished before the tenth year of their age.  The same general mortality had ruled for upwards of 30 years, it being no heavier in 1780, when smallpox deaths were  140  DR. FARR ON DR. WAIT.  25 per cent, of the whole number of deaths, than in 1813, when they were only 4 per cent.  " This,' - ' says Dr. Watt, " was a discovery I by no means " expected, and how it could have come to pass appeared to " me inexplicable. From every circumstance which had come " under my observation, the efficacy of vaccine inoculation " appeared certain. The experience of 13 years pretty exten- " sive practice had confirmed me fully in this opinion. But the " question recurred, how are we to account for the same or " nearly the same number of deaths under 10 years of age? " As no new disease has appeared, the smallpox must have " been made up by a greater mortality among the other " diseases of children.  " Has it been equally divided among them, or has a greater "share fallen on some than others?"  Dr. Farr, of the Registrar-General's office, commenting on these observations (vol. 30, page 214), by Dr. Watt, makes the following important and apposite remark, showing incon- testibly that there is no saving of infant life by vaccination : -  " The mortality of children is as high, probably higher, than it " was in the last 18 years of the last century  These observations made by Dr. Watt, of Glasgow, so long ago as the year 1813, had evidently been lost sight of until Dr. Farr quoted them in the Annual Report of the Registrar- General in the year 1840, vol. 30, page 214.  At pages 40 and 41 of the Report of the Select Committee, 1 87 1, will be seen my reproduction of the important facts which had lain dormant so long.  At the same time I expressed my concurrence in the opinion expressed by Dr. Farr, in the following sensible remark. " To " operate on the mortality, protection against everyone of the " fatal zymotic diseases is required, otherwise the suppression ' of one disease element opens the way to others."  increase of inocuLable diseases. 141  It has been said in disparagement of statistics that figures may be made to prove everything. Facts, however, when indisputable, are the weapons with which this great battle between Vaccinists and Anti-vaccinists must be fought out. By facts in figures, the vaccine theory will be exploded.  In a Parliamentary paper, a return ordered by the House of Commons, at the suggestion of Mr. Hopwood, the Member for Stockport, on the 2nd of September, 1880, we have pre- sented to us a number of facts which completely answer the question, " Does vaccination save infant life?"  It is not disputed that fewer now die from smallpox in infancy than formerly, but other diseases have taken its place, while there is every reason to fear, to put it mildly, that the increased mortality from inoculable and constitutional diseases, is the consequence of infiltrating the lymphatics of infants of tender age.  The return alluded to gives the death-rate per million of infants a year old, from nine different causes, as the condensed Table (No. LIII.) shows. Of these nine diseases, six are without doubt inoculable, and may therefore be implanted as a seed contained in the vehicle called vaccine lymph, viz., syphilis, scrofula, tabes-mesenterica, skin diseases, erysipelas, and phlegmon, including pyaemia. The remaining two in the classi- fication, bronchitis and diarrhoea, it may be urged, are chiefly from climatic causes, severe cold, and severe heat. While atrophy and debility, including premature births, may be elimi- nated from diseases originating in poverty, neglect, and strong drink. The number of deaths under this head is appalling. That a large proportion are caused by vaccination, I have reason to suspect from the number of infants I have seen where atrophy has followed vaccination.

STATISTICS INDISPUTABLE. 143  The preceding Table (No. LIII.) exhibits at a glance the frightful increase of Infantile Syphilis.  In the first period, 184710 1854, the annual average death-rate of infants from this cause was 607. In the second period, 1855 to 1866, the death-rate increased to nearly double, being 1,197, and in the third period, to no less than 1,738 or nearly trebled.  If we look at the second column of causes - Scrofula - we find a similar advance, from 366 in the first period, 607 in the second, and to 892 in the third period.  The third column - Tabes Mesenterica - the advance in mortality is in round numbers, from 3,000 in the first period, to 4,300 in the third.  Columns 4 and 5 - Skin Diseases and Erysipelas - together advanced from 998 in the first period, to 1,152 in the third period.  I need not advert to the remaining columns. The reader has before him an abundance of indisputable facts.  It may be remembered that when Mr. Sclater-Booth was asked by Earl Percy whether my Vital Statistics* No. I., were reliable, the reply given to his Lordship was, " We do not dispute the figures, but we take exception to the inference."  I leave my readers to draw their own inference. There is but one, and that is, that Infant mortality has increased since vaccinatiom was made compulsory, that increased mortality has kept pace with the steps, in the shape of Acts of Parlia- ment, to the operation of which Acts, this increase is due.  I think I need go no further in the production of evidence to prove that the lamentable increase of Infant mortality is a sufficient answer to the mistaken assertion that vaccination has saved millions of lives.  * See concluding portion of this Essay.  t44  VACCINE. WHAT IS IT?  VACCINE. WHAT IS IT ?  I cannot conclude this Essay without adverting to this all-important matter - What is meant by lymph ?  Not one of the series of Acts of Parliament, under which the practice called vaccination, is enforced defines what is meant. Neither in preamble or section. No provision or direction as to its source or nature is to be found. Indeed, Parliament, acting under dictation nominally from Her Majesty's Privy Council, which really meant Mr. Simon, its Medical Officer, passed the Compulsory Act, without the slightest manifestation of desire on the part of the people. By this Act the crime of vaccination is enforced, and honest, conscientious people are made criminals, fined and imprisoned for disobedience to a human* law, which, if obeyed, renders them criminals in the sight of a higher law.  Parliament needed to be educated - that process is now in due course. One of the Members of the House of Commons, Dr. Cameron, who is a stedfast believer in vaccination, has told the House that it is the duty of Parliament, through the Local Government Board to provide lymph from calves in which the disease has been artificially planted.  Dr. Cameron tells the House that arm to arm vaccination should be abolished, on account of the danger of inoculating other diseases with the lymph. Besides all this, Dr. Cameron tells the House that the lymph now in use supplied by  * For human, read inhuman.  JENNER 1 AN LYMPH. 145  Government is bad, worn out, & c., &c. His words were thus reported in the Times, London daily paper : -  " The recurrence of smallpox, therefore, in the latest period " of mortality, almost as high as that experienced prior to the "Vaccination Act, shows either that the protective virtues of " vaccination arc mythical, or that there is something radically " wrong in our national system of vaccination."  How many kinds or varieties of lymph are now in circula- tion it is well nigh impossible to define, with the mingling one with another, and modifying by successive transfers from child to child.  We ask what is lymph ?  First, we have Jennerian lymph, which has come down to us from his day. What it is or was, is described thus in Dr. Jenneds original work, published in 1801, dated Berkeley, Gloucestershire, December 20, 1799. The title of the work is, "An Inquiry into the causes and effects of the Variola; Vaccinae; a Disease discovered in some of the Western Counties of England, particularly Gloucestershire, and known by the name of  The Cow Pox.  The Third Edition.  Dedicated to the King."  At page 2 of that work, the following description of vaccine matter is found : -  " There is a disease to which the horse, from his state of "domestication, is frequently subject. The farriers [veteri- " naries] have called it the grease. It is an inflammation, and " swelling of the heel, accompanied at its commencement with " small cracks or fissures, from which issues a limpid fluid, pos- " sessing properties of a very peculiar kind. This fluid seems " capable of generating a disease in the human body (after it L  146  cowpox DISEASE.  "has undergone the modification I shall presently speak of) " which bears so strong a resemblance to the smallpox, that I " think it highly probable it may be the source of that disease."  " In this Dairy county a great number of cows are kept, and the office of milking is performed indiscriminately by men and maid-servants. One of the former having been appointed to apply dressings to the heels of a horse affected with the malady I have mentioned, and not paying due attention to cleanliness, incautiously bears his part in milking the cows, with some par- ticles of the infectious matter adhering to his fingers. When this is the case it frequently happens that the disease is com- municated to the cows, and from the cows to the dairymaids, which spreads through the farm, until most of the cattle and domestics feel its unpleasant consequences."  "This disease has obtained the name of the cowpox. It appears on the nipples of the cows, in the form of irregular pustules. At their first appearance, they are generally of a palish blue, or rather of a colour somewhat approaching to livid, and are surrounded by an inflammation. These pustules , unless a timely remedy be applied, frequently degenerate into phagsedenic ulcers, which prove extremely troublesome. The animals become indisposed, and the secretion of milk is much lessened.  " Inflamed spots now begin to appear on different parts of the hands of the domestics employed in milking, and sometimes on the wrists, which run on to suppuration, first assuming the appearance of small vesications produced by a burn. Most commonly they appear about the joints of the fingers, and at their extremities : but whatever parts are affected, if the situation will admit, these superficial suppurations put on a circular form, with their edges more elevated than their centre, and of a colour distantly approaching to blue. Absorption  EFFECTS OF cowpox. 147  takes place, and tumours appear in each axilla. The system becomes affected, the pulse is quickened. Shiverings, suc- ceeded by heat, general lassitude, and pains about the loins and limbs, with vomiting, come on. The head is painful, and the patient is now and then even affected with delirium. These symptoms, varying in their degrees of violence, generally continue from one day to three or four, leaving ulcerated sores about the hands ; which, from the sensibility of the parts, are very troublesome, and commonly heal very slowly, frequently becoming phagedenic, like those from which they sprung. During the progress of the disease, the lips, nostrils, eyelids, and other parts of the body are sometimes affected with sores, but these evidently arise from their being heedlessly rubbed or scratched with the patient's infected fingers. No eruptions on the skin have followed the decline of the feverish symptoms, in any instance that has come under my inspection, one only excepted - and in this case very few appeared on the arms. They were very minute, of a vivid, red colour, and soon died away without advancing to maturation. So that I cannot determine whether they had any connection with the preceding symptoms."  "Thus the disease makes its progress from the horse (as I conceive) to the nipple of the cow, and from the cow to the human subject. Morbid matter of various kinds, when absorbed into the system, may produce effects in some degree similar. But what renders the cowpox virus so extremely sin- gular is that the person who has been thus affected is for ever after secure from the infection of the smallpox ; neither exposure to the variolous effluvia, nor the insertion of the matter into the skin, producing this distemper."  " In support of so extraordinary a fact, I shall lay before my reader a great number of instances. But, first, it is necessary  148  SPONTANEOUS cowpox NOT RELIAIJLE.  to observe that pustulous sores frequently appear spontaneously on the nipples of the cows; and instances have occurred, though very rarely, of the hands of the servants employed in milking being affected with sores in consequence, and even of their feeling an indisposition from absorption. These pustules are of a much milder nature than those which arise from that contagion which constitutes the true cowpox. They are always free from the blueish or livid tint so conspicuous in that disease. No erysipelas attends them, nor do they show any phagsedenic disposition, as in the other case, but quickly terminate in a scab without creating any apparent disorder in the cow, This complaint appears at various seasons of the year, but most commonly in the spring, when the cows are first taken from their winter food, and fed with grass. It is very apt to appear also when they are suckling their young. But this disease is not to be considered as similar in any respect to that of which I am treating, as it is incapable of producing any specific effects on the human con- stitution. However, it is of the greatest consequence to point it out here, lest the want of discrimination should occasion an idea of security from the infectioti of the smallpox , which might prove delusive ."  In the foregoing quotation we have a full description of Jennerian " virus."  Summarised we have first, necessarily, a " decrepid old oss," as I heard a veterinary's stableman describe what the disease called " grease " is.  Secondly, we have the purulent matter exuded from the sores on its heels. This is transferred to the udder of a milch cow - therein maturing, phagaedenic ulcers appear.  Thirdly, the matter from these ulcers is transplanted in the milk-maid.  HORSE POX.  149  Fourthly, we have the description by Jenner of the serious constitutional disturbance which follows, and the local suffering of those who are " thus affected."  So much for the true preventive cowpox virus.  Dr. Jenner goes on to say that the spontaneous cowpox is not protective. " The pustules are of a much milder nature than those which constitute the true cowpox."  He strongly cautions his confreres against making use of spontaneous or natural cowpox, lest the want of discrimination should occasion an idea of security from the infection of  smallpox  which might prove delusive. A convenient loop-hole out of a difficulty.  I have so far quoted from the original work of Jenner. A perusal of Baron's life of Jenner leads us to an acquaintance with details not at all comforting to those with whom cleanliness is a part of their religion.  Baron says, vol. i., page 242 : -  " Although there is now no room for any doubt that variolae " may be thus derived [from the fissured heel of the horse], yet it is "probable that the "grease," as it is called, in the horse's heel, " is only the mode in which the disease commonly exhibits itself " in that animal."  The following remarks of Dr. Jenner himself will best illus- trate this statement : -  " The skin of the horse is subject to an eruptive disease of a " vesicular character, which vesicle contains a limpid fluid "showing itself most commonly in the heels. The legs " first become ajdematous, and then fissures are observed.  " The skin contiguous to these fissures is seen studded with "small vesicles, surrounded by an areola. These vesicles "contain the specific fluid. It is the ill-management of the " horse in the stable that occasions the malady to appear more  150 smallPOX VIRUS MODIFIED BY CEELY,  " frequently in the heel than in other parts.* I have detected " it connected with a sore in the neck of the horse, and in the " thigh of a colt."  Baron adds : -  " It has been established by unquestionable evidence that " matter from a horse does produce a pustule similar in appear- ance to the vaccine ; and likewise possessing the same pro- " tecting power ; and that without having passed through the " constitution of the cow."  Baron goes on to say, that a disease analogous in its nature to that of cowpox exists in the horse, the sheep, the goat, the she-ass, and the dog - all these poxes having the same origin, and identical with the human smallpox.  Some of these poxes got mixed up, and thus commingled, and the evil was propagated over many parts of Europe. The disease resulting from the mixture of variola and vaccine was milder in its nature than ordinary smallpox, but very dif- ferent from the benign solitary pustule which characterizes the variolae vaccina;, j  Whether or not the original virus of Jenner is still extant, it matters not. We have, it is well known, had lymph, mis-called vaccine, circulating all over the kingdom, and not only here but in our colonies, which have for years been supplied from this country. This lymph has chiefly been obtained by inoculating cows with matter from smallpox pustules in the human subject. It is well known that the late Mr. Ceely, of Aylesbury, obtained lymph by this method, so also did Mr. Badcock, of Brighton, subsequently of Camberwell Grove, London. The late Sir J. Cordy Burrows, M.D., of Brighton, bore testimony to the practice in the following words : -  "The people seemed scarcely to understand what vaccination  * j- Baron'sLife of Jenner, vol. i., p. 244.  MR. BADCOCK'S LYMPH.  151  t' meant. The vaccine lymph taken from a child was nothing " more than what had originally passed from a smallpox patie?it " through a cow. In 1856-58, he took an active part in the "movement, and assisted in inoculating seventeen cows, " producing in three cases ' vaccine lymph,' and from these the "world was supplied."  Mr. Badcock with such " lymph " vaccinated fourteen thousand persons, and forwarded supplies of it to more than four hundred practitioners.  These experiments have beguiled the profession, and the people, into the belief that this stuff thus obtained|is cowpox lymph.  The following little paragraph from the speech of Dr. Cameron, in the House of Commons, is in substance a repe- tition of what I had stated to the Committee in 1871 : -  "Now what I want to know is what has become of this " lymph ? My reason for asking the question is that more " recent and searching experiment has demonstrated that it is " not vaccine ly?nph at all , but smallpox lymph."  And thus it was that the people have had imposed upon them a delusive sham, under the protection of an Act of Parliament. No responsibility attaches to the vaccinator, whatever happens to the victim, for the Act, as I have stated above, does not define the nature or source of the diseased matter engrafted into the systems of innocents. No responsibility ? ! !  No, indeed. Dr. Stevens, a salaried Government Inspector of Vaccination, under the Local Government Board, stated at the recent Congress of Medical men, that -  " He had seen more vaccinated children than any man " either alive or who had lived, and all his experience led him " to the opinion that the arm to arm system practised in this  152  VARIOUS KINDS OF LYMPH.  " country was as nearly perfect as a system could be made, " and as efficacious as could be desired ."  It need not be inquired here, which of these the Government should believe - Dr. Cameron, an independent Member of the House of Commons - or Dr. Stevens, the salaried official of the Local Government Board ?  There is no agreement among vaccinists as to where proper lymph is to be had. How many more there are it is difficult to tell. How many more there will be, it is impossible to predict.  The following is an enumeration of a few : -  No. i. Jennerian  horsepox ed cowpox.  No. 2.*Jennerian  horsepox , pure and simple  No. 3. Swine-pox, with which Jenner inoculated his eldest son.f  All the foregoing he considered protective.  No. 4. Spontaneous Gloucestershire cowpox.  No. 5. Human smallpox - cow modified, by Ceely, Badcock, and Co.  Then we have importations of -  No. 6. Passy lymph.  No. 7. Beaugency lymph.  No. 8. Brussels lymph.  And to be had wholesale, " calf lymph," at the various factories instituted by the medical traders in lymph-virus, whose incomes are in amount by no means trivial.  What confusion, yet what mystical properties, nevertheless, are attributed to all these various kinds of lymph.  * In Baron's Life of Jenner, vol. 2, pp. 225-6. see, "In 1817, Jenner inoculated direct from the horse, without the intervention of the cow, and with this matter he supplied the National Vaccine establishment, and it was extensively distributed in England and Scotland. ''  f This child died, aged 20, of consumption.  HEIFER LYMPH.  153  I have not noticed all that are in circulation. There is syphilitic lymph, scrofula lymph ; there is also lymph from the consumptive, and it may be from a thousand modifications of disease.  To obviate the " untoward accidents " alluded to in my letter to Mr. Sclater-Booth, which will be found at the end of this volume, an outcry has been raised for vaccination direct from the calf.  Heifer-derived lymph is no novelty on the Continent. It has been adopted in France by Dr. Depaul, M. Lanoix, and Dr. Chambon. In Berlin by Dr. Pissin, in 1865. In Brussels by Dr. Warlomont. In Russia by M. Proseroff, under the direction of the Government. In Naples by Dr. Negri, who was the first to adopt animal vaccination, propagated upon a succession of calves, the original virus being obtained from pocks in cows spontaneously affected with the natural disease. In the spring of 1868 it was adopted in Rotterdam, and in Amsterdam in 1869. In Vienna, also, animal vaccination has been tried.  With what result will be shown in the next epidemic.  It has been contended by Dr. Chas. Drysdale, and others, that the production of a vesicle by calf lymph is a proof of suc- cessful vaccination. Dr. Drysdale contended that this is the case, in a paper he read before the Medical Society of London. My reply on that occasion was, that the only test of success is to be sought in recurring epidemics, and not in the appearance and character of the vesicle.  This was the ground I took when giving evidence before the Committee of 1871. Yet vaccine authorities have the effrontery to assert that the vaccination Inspectors can decide the question of successful or unsuccessful vaccinations.  So far as the operation is concerned, it may be successfully  I 54  SURGEON BIRCH ON COW POX.  performed, but the idea associated with the term, " successful vaccination " is that of security against taking smallpox.  To assume that the perfect vesicle is a proof of protection is simply a repetition of the presumption of Jenner when he stated, " a priori," that the recipient of his virus was "protected for ever " - " a posteriori ," an exploded fallacy.  Pertinent and potent were the words of Mr. Birch, Surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital, and to the Prince of Wales, King George the Fourth, in a work published in the year 1807, entitled, " Serious reasons for uniformly objecting to the practice of Vaccination." They are as follows, at page 72 : -  " We are yet left unsatisfied as to the nature and origin of " what is called cowpox. It is a disorder known only to the ' cow doctor in dirty dairies, though we are taught to play " with it as a blessing revealed from heaven to this enlightened "age."  This observation of an eminent surgeon made in the year 1807, is as applicable in the year 1881. cowpox, like  smallpox , is a " dirt disease," - a "disease of filth." The idea of pro- tecting the body from disease by septic poisoning is so incon- sistent with every principle of sanitary science and wisdom, that it is amazing that intelligent people should catch at such straws as cow, horse, or heifer-poxing to save them from smallpox.  I cannot conclude this chapter better than by adopting the memorable words of Lord Mahon, quoted by Mr. Dudgeon, of Quorn : -  " It is a melancholy reflection for human nature how easily "and completely even the most intelligent classes, of even the "most intelligent people may sometimes be imposed upon. " There seems some inherent proneness in mankind to " great national delusions. The same men whom  CREDULITY OF THE PRESS.  155  "we find as individuals, watchful and wary, not readily " trusting professions, nor often misled by appearances, will "as a body often swallow, open-mouthed, the most glaring " absurdities and contradictions ; and the press which ought to be " detectors of such delusions, will sometimes stoop to be their " instruments."  ADDENDUM.  The following reprint, with additions of the Author's letter to the Right Hon. G. Sclater-Booth, M.P., under the title of "Vital Statistics," is added to the foregoing Essay, at the request of a number of friends, showing as it does at a glance, the increase of smallpox in England and Wales, notwithstand- ing the vigilance of Vaccination authorities ; pointing out also the dangers arising from Vaccination in the production of diseases more serious than that of smallpox.  It is now universally admitted by the Profession that such dangers do exist - a fact which, when stated by the Author* when examined in 1871, was not only doubted, but the possi- bility denied by those who had committed themselves to the orthodox belief that it was impossible.  The Author has been flattered by communications on all sides - not confined to this country, but also from the Conti- nents of Europe and America, on the production of facts entirely unanticipated, and which the Author is informed has done more than any other work to attract the attention of the Profession, Parliament, and the Public.  The stupendous and startling facts thus made known regard- ing the Author's native country, led him to an extensive inquiry regarding our Continental neighbours, the result of still more extended inquiries is the presentation of the foregoing Essay.

The second and third columns of figures are furnished by the Local Government Board. Tenth Annual Report.  The numbers and causes of death are from the Registrar General's reports : certified at Somerset House.  To the Rig] it Honourable G. Sc later- Booth, M.P., &c., President of the Local Government Board.  Sir, -  I beg to submit to your notice in the following pages a few statistical facts which at the present moment, in the midst of an epidemic of smallpox, have special interest.  While the country is agitated and alarmed at the increase of smallpox, notwithstanding the vigilance with which the Vac- cination Laws are enforced, and the compulsory isolation of patients in hospitals in every direction, it becomes our duty to inquire how it is, that after seventy years of Vaccination, in the last twenty-four of which the compulsory law has prevailed, the disease carries off a larger number in each epidemic visitation.  It was confidently predicted that the endowment and enforcement of Vaccination by the State would speedily extirpate smallpox; it is to be regretted, however, that here, as in Sweden and Germany, the most vaccinated countries, the disease increases in mortality in spite of Vaccination.  It will be seen by a glance at the table of figures presented herein to your notice, that so far from smallpox having diminished in mortality since the Act of 1853, when Vaccination was made compulsory, it has increased ; thus, in the first epidemic since the Act came into operation, viz., in the Years  1857-8-9 the deaths were .... 14,244 1863-4-5 (the second epidemic) they rose to 20,059 1870-1-2 (the third epidemic) they reached 44,840  smallPOX ENGLAND AND WALES AND LONDON. l6l  So that, notwithstanding the very considerable increase in the number of Vaccinations, the disease has advanced in an increas- ing ratio.  Indeed, while the population increased between the firsj. and second epidemics seven per cent, the deaths from smallpox increased forty per cent. ; and while from the second to the third epidemic the population increased ten per cent ., the  smallpox  deaths increased no less than one hundred and twenty per cent. Or if we take two decennial periods from the passing of the compulsory law in 1853 we find the  So much for Vaccination in relation to smallpox, in England and Wales.  The Registrar General in his recently issued Annual Summary, for the year 1880, thus tabulates the smallpox mortality of London for the last 30 years : -  1851-60 2,570,489 7,150.  1871 - 80 3,466,48 6 1 5jS 43-  Let me now direct your attention to the sad increase of Infantile Erysipelas concurrently with the increased number of infantile vaccinations.  Taking the five years 1860-4, and contrasting them with five more recent years 1870-4, we find the following figures : -  Deaths from 1854 to '63 were 33,515 and from 1864 to '73 " 70,458  Decades.  Estimated Mean Population.   smallpox  Deaths.   M  162  INCREASE OF ERYSIPELAS.  DEATHS FROM ERYSIPELAS.

Erysipelas is now an infantile disease, and it is to be noted that Erysipelatous symptoms are the recognised effects of proper Vaccination. The connection, therefore, between Vaccination and Erysipelas is established, and has lately been fatally shown in the deaths of eight children in the Gainsborough Union,* reported upon to your Board by Mr J. Netten Radcliffe, one of the staff of Inspectors attached to the Local Government Board. In Leeds and Liverpool similar cases have occurred, and all may be taken as special instances confirmatory of the general deductions to be drawn from the tables herein contained.  The third point which I feel it my duty to bring under your notice is, that another fatal - a loathsome - disease has increased concurrently with increased Vaccination: I allude to Syphilis.  That Syphilis has been conveyed together with vaccine lymph, ample and sad proof was adduced before the Select Committee of the House of Commons, 1871, on the Vaccination  ; i : Two more deaths have since been added to the list.  VACCINO-SYPHILIS.  163  Acts. It is there recorded that eleven young persons four of them women, engaged in a house of business at the West-end of London were Vaccinated by order of their employer. The child selected was obtained at one of the London "State Vaccine Stations." Those eleven victims were Syphilised from that child and were placed, by direction of the late Medical Officer of the Privy Council, under the care of Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson, to whose evidence, page 283 of the Report, I must direct your attention for the details.  Dr. Ballard, one of the Official Inspectors of the Local Government Board, in his "Essay on Vaccination," relates some unfortunate occurrences, in which no fewer than ^7 children were Vaccino-syphilised, of whom a considerable number died. Nurses and mothers were diseased through suckling these infants, and Syphilis was thus conveyed through Vaccination from children to mothers, and from these to their husbands.  The fact being thus fully established that Syphilis is some- times conveyed in Vaccine lymph, reference to the Table will show the strong probability of the frequent occurrence of this calamity.  It will be seen that there died of Syphilis in the  Five years  Under one year old  Of all ages  1860-1-2-3-4  4 ) 5°4  6,425  1870-1-2-3-4  7,009  9 , 27 !  In the first period, therefore, nearly two-thirds of the whole number were under one year old (the year of Vaccination), while in the second period, when the number of Vaccinations  164 MORTALITY FROM THREE CAUSES.  had greatly increased, no less than seven-ninths of the whole number of deaths were of infants not a year old.  I am not aware that vice and immorality have, in this country, increased to such an extent as to account for this fact; but I have reason to know, from thirty years' professional experience, that arm-to-arm Vaccination is followed by unto- ward accidents of this nature, and indeed, safety cannot be guaranteed by the State , seeing that in the eleven cases referred to the above child presented no signs of Syphilis when thelymph was taken, and it was only discovered when the mischief had been done.  To whatever cause or causes the increased mortality from this terrible disease may be attributed, I submit that to  vaccination tion must be awarded a large share.  The annexed table shows the increase from one period of five years to the other of the three diseases referred to : -  Five years  Deaths from  Deaths from Erysipelas  Deaths from Syphilis *  smallpox  Under 1 year  Under  5years  All ages  Under 1 year  All ages  1st period, 1860-1-2-3-4  19,346  2,698  3,280  S>754  4504  6,425  2nd period, 1870-1-2-3-4  49,366  3,550  4,021  11,600  7009  9,271  Beyond all this sad increase of suffering and mortality, there is another serious aspect of the question - the increasing resistance of the people to a law they consider oppressive, because they are unconvinced of the efficacy of the process it  * The increase of Syphilis under one year old is slightly over fifty per cent., and of all ages slightly under fifty per cent.  smallPOX, ERYSIPELAS, AND SYPHILIS. 1 65  enforces, while of its accompanying dangers they have, as they believe, sufficient evidence.  I have thus briefly placed the foregoing facts under your notice in the hope that the whole subject of Vaccination will be reconsidered in all its bearings, and rigidly inquired into by a Royal Commission.  I have the honour to remain, Sir,  Your obedient servant,  CHARLES T. PEARCE.  London, February 20, 1877.  Notes on the History of Inoculatio?i and Vaccination in England,  with List of the principal Acts of Parliament relating thereto.  The practice of inoculation with the smallpox was intro- duced into this country from Turkey in the year 1722.  An hospital for the reception of patients suffering from  smallpox , and for propagating the same disease by inoculation, was established in London in the year 1746.  After much controversy, the College of Physicians in London adopted inoculation in 1754, and "considered it highly beneficial to mankind."  smallpox was thus kept constantly alive by means of inoculation, to the end of the century, and continued to provide new centres of contagion. The mortality considerably increased.  In 1798 the belief in the utility of inoculation with smallpox was greatly lessened ; at which time Dr. Jenner published his "Observations on the cowpox," having vaccinated for the first time 14th May, 1796.  Dr. Jenner petitioned Parliament for a reward for his dis- covery in 1S02, and affirmed his belief that " the annihilation of the smallpox must be the final result of the practice of  vaccination tion." In the same year the House of Commons voted him 10,000. But many eminent members of the faculty thought the action of Parliament too precipitate.  In 1803 the Royal Jennerian Society was formed, and a belief was cherished that smallpox was about to be exterminated.  In 1807 the Royal College of Physicians reported that "the security derived from vaccination, if not absolutely  VACCINATION IN ENGLAND. 1 67  perfect, is as nearly so, as perhaps can be expected from any human discovery."  In the same year the House of Commons, in Committee of Supply, voted an additional grant of ^20,000 to Dr. Jenner; the motion of Mr. Shaw Lefevre to take more time to consider the Report of the College of Physicians, and of Sir Francis Burdett being rejected. The grant was passed by 60 to 47.  The National Vaccine Establishment was founded in 1808-9, an d supported by an annual grant from the Public Purse, and the privilege of free post. The Reports issued annually from 1810 to i860, vary considerably in the degree of confidence in which the suppression of smallpox is predicted.  In 1833 a Committee of the House of Commons, appointed to enquire into the utility of the Vaccine Establishment, reported, that " The Committee are led to believe that the pre- judices against vaccination are greatly on the decrease through- out the country ; and that the authority of the Managing Board is not necessary to enable vaccination to withstand these prejudices."  In 1840, inoculation for the  smallpox  was made a penal offence by Act of Parliament, and in that and the following year, Boards of Guardians were empowered to provide for the cost of vaccinating parishioners out of the poor-rates.  In 1841, an Act to amend an Act was passed to extend the practice of vaccination.  In 1853, an Act to extend and make compulsory the practice of vaccination was passed, notwithstanding the promise of the Government that enquiry should precede any further legislation on the subject.  In June, 1855, Mr. John Gibbs addressed a letter to the President of the Board of Health, Sir Benjamin Hall, on the Scientific, Religious, and Political Aspects of Compul  1 68 NOTES ON THE HISTORY OF INOCULATION, ETC.  sory Vaccination. This was ordered to be printed by the House of Commons.  In 1856 a Bill was introduced into the House of Commons, which contained the monstrous clause to forcibly vaccinate every child up to 13 years of age; and another Clause to empower Coroners to hold an inquest on the body of every child dying of smallpox if not vaccinated.  In 1856 the medical officer of the Privy Council, addressing members of the medical profession, and referring to objections to the course of the legislation, urged during the previous Session of Parliament, thus wrote : " The President of the Board of Health intends forthwith, on the meeting of Parlia- ment, to move the House of Commons for a Select Committee on the entire subject, which Committee if appointed would no doubt receive whatever evidence can be adduced as to the hygienic value of vaccination, and as to the validity of any me- dical objections alleged against its further encouragement by the State."  In 1857 a Bill was introduced by private Members to repeal the Act of 1853, but not passed.  In Measures to amend and extend the provisions of the Act of 1853 were subsequently passed.  In 1863 the law enforcing vaccination was extended to Scotland and Ireland.  In 1867 an Act to consolidate and amend the laws relating to vaccination was passed.  In 1871 a Select Committee of the House of Commons to inquire into the Act of 1867, a Report of which was ordered to be printed.  In 1871 a more stringent Act was passed compelling Boards of Guardians to prosecute.  ACTS OF PARLIAMENT RELATING TO VACCINATION.  ENGLAND AND WALES.  3rd & 4th Vic. c. 29.

The Bill was rejected.  TABLE OF CONTENTS.  :  v  r  ?  A.
